 No thanks . I don't smoke .  
 That's terrible . What can we do about it ?  
 That's great news . We should all be doing our bit to reduce our carbon footprint .  
 That's not true .  
 I don't have any weaknesses .  
 It will take us about 3 hours to drive to London .  
 You failed the test . You didn't follow the rules of the road .  
 Nothing . How are you ?  
 I'm not sure . How about you ?  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you . Goodbye .  
 No . Thank you . I'll call back . Goodbye .  
 No . I'm free .  
 That's okay . I'm just glad you're here .  
 I'm sorry . We don't have that book . Can I help you find something else ?
 No , I don't .  
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any rooms available .  
 Sure . Here you are .  
 No , thank you . I'm just browsing .  
 I don't think that's a good idea . You should be spending time with your family instead .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for a good book to read .  
 I didn't pull you over .  
 No . We don't do that here .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can do that .  
 That's a good idea . You should try to eat more fruits and vegetables .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 I'm not feeling very well .  
 I don't think I'm interested in insurance .  
 No . I'm just looking .  
 No , I didn't . But I'm glad we got a table .  
 I'm not good at writing .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in meeting him .  
 No . I can't help you now .  
 No . I've never worked in advertising .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 No . Have you ?  
 I don't need any help .  
 No . I'm just browsing .  
 I didn't take the money . You are the one who stole it . You are the cheater .
 I'm sorry , but Professor Clark is not available at the moment . May I take a message for him ?  
 No . I called for a doctor .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you . I'm not very good at meeting new people .  
 I'll have a whisky .  
 I'm not feeling well . I have a headache .  
 It's not here . You should have gone before you came .  
 I don't know . You should ask the person at the counter .
 I'm not cooking anything . I'm just sitting here watching TV .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see what you look like .  
 No way . I'm not going to do that .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can make it .  
 No , I haven't .  
 No , I will take the Mercedes .  
 Sure . I'll get right on it .  
 I don't like seafood . It's too fishy .
 I don't know . Where do you want to go ?  
 It's not unusual . It's just a common tea set .  
 I'm going to the store .  
 No way . I'm not going to get it for you .
 Good morning . Vane Theater , at your service .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can do it . I have a lot of other things to do .  
 I don't like salad . 
 No . You can't have any fish . You have to eat your vegetables .  
 I don't think I'm qualified to give you advice . I'm just a high school student .  
 I don't think so . The boss is always stingy .  
 That's all right . I'll call you back later .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in opening a new account .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to browse around .  
 I don't know . I just heard a loud noise .  
 I'm sorry . We don't sell chocolate bars here .  
 No , you may not .  
 I ’ m sorry , Richard . I can ’ t help you right now . I ’ m busy .  
 No . You may not come in . Please leave the room .  
 No , she's just happy .  
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any inexpensive cashmere sweaters .  
 They're not apples . They're oranges .  
 No , I'm busy .  
 Nothing . I'm just looking for something to do .  
 No , I don't have it .  
 No way . It's not mine . It's my father's .  
 No problem . I'll be there .  
 I'm sorry . I can't check that . Please try again .  
 No , nothing's wrong .  
 I'll be leaving tomorrow .  
 No thanks . I'm full .  
 No . I'm sorry . I don't know .  
 That's okay . I'm just glad you're here .  
 No , I don't . But I can recommend some places to you .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't help you . Goodbye .  
 No .  
 I don't get road news .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 Sure . What date and time would you like ?  
 I'm just passing through .  
 No , it's not .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested .  
 No one can help you . You are on your own .  
 I'd like to eat something that's not too spicy .  
 I don't know .  
 That's not a good idea . You should be careful about what you say .  
 I don't know .  
 No . I don't like seafood .  
 I'm sorry , Professor Clark is not available at the moment . May I take a message for him ?  
 I ’ m not doing well . I ’ m having a hard time with my job .  
 It's not slow at all . It's just that you're not used to it .  
 What's wrong ?  
 Nothing .  
 No , I don't want anything sweet .  
 No . I don't want to .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't do that .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any pearls .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 I don't want to talk about myself .  
 I don't know . You should ask the teacher .  
 That's right . But the traffic is still moving smoothly .  
 It looks like it needs a lot of work .  
 I'm sorry , sir . We don't serve wine before the main course .  
 No way . I'm not going anywhere .  
 No . She isn't .  
 Sure . Good night .  
 No , I haven't .  
 Why are you so worried ?  
 No , it's not big enough . You should get a bigger one .  
 I'm not going anywhere .  
 No thanks . I'd rather stay at home and watch TV .  
 No , I haven't seen it . It's too far away .  
 I'd like to book a flight to Los Angeles .  
 No . It's demand .
 I don't think I want to meet him . He seems to be a very unpleasant person .  
 I'd like to have a cup of coffee .  
 I don't have any insurance background .  
 No , we're not . Where are we ?
 No . I don't think so .  
 No , I'm busy .  
 Sure . Here's how you do it . First , you put your clothes in the washer . Then you add the detergent . After that , you close the lid and push the start button . Finally , you put the clothes in the dryer and push the start button . That's it .  
 No . 
 I'm not hungry .  
 I don't think so . I don't want to sign the contract .
 That's a good idea . You should buy a black suit .  
 I'm fine . How can I help you ?  
 No . I'm sorry . I don't think I know you .  
 No , I don't think so . I think I need more information about your company .  
 That's too bad . I hope you feel better soon .  
 I think I'm a bit of a loner .  
 I don't think she is qualified enough for the position .
 No . I was not .  
 No , I don't think that's a good idea . We should just stay home and watch TV .  
 That's great . Do you have any other hobbies ?  
 No . I'm not proficient in both written and spoken English .  
 No . I want to keep them .  
 You're just getting older . There's nothing much you can do about it .  
 I usually get up at 6:30 and have a cup of coffee . Then I go for a run and do some stretching exercises . After that I take a shower and get dressed . I usually have breakfast at 8:00 and then I start my work .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any cosmetics .  
 I don't know . I've never been to a foreign country before .  
 Sure . How about next weekend ?  
 No . We don't have any package tours to Hollywood .  
 I ’ m sorry . I didn ’ t mean to . I ’ m just trying to help .  
 No way . I'm not buying anything .  
 No , go ahead .  
 No , I'm just looking .  
 No . We don't have to .  
 The train for Tibet doesn't leave from here .  
 No way . I'm not going to pay for your ride .  
 I'm sorry , I can't check in any luggage . I'm just here to pick up my family .  
 I'd like to leave on the 15th .  
 We don't have any black suits in stock .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see how you were doing .  
 No , I'm busy . Can I help you ?  
 No .  
 I don't know . I think I'm just not good at it .  
 No . I'm just browsing .  
 No thanks . I'm not really in the mood for it .  
 No , I can’t tell .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 It's not grand at all . It's just a big square with a few buildings around it .  
 That's too bad . Are you okay ?  
 No . I'm sorry . I can't work during the weekend .  
 No way . I'll never let you take my baby .  
 That's too bad . Is there anything I can do to help ?  
 I'm sorry , but we don't do that kind of work here .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you . Goodbye .  
 No . I'm just looking .  
 No , I don't .  
 That's interesting . Do you have any particular pieces that you're interested in ?  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not sure what you're talking about .  
 I don't like it here . It's too noisy and the food is not good .  
 We are not hiring at the moment .  
 No , thank you . I just wanted to look around .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 That's too bad . You should have thought of that before you submitted your work . Now you have to do it all over again .  
 No way . You're not going anywhere . You're staying here and facing the music .  
 No thanks . I'm full . Positive Response:  Sure . I'll have another helping .  
 No , it doesn't . You should take the bus that goes to the old bookstore .  
 Not well . I'm having trouble finding a dress .  
 No . I don't have any round-neck sweater .  
 No thanks . I'll pass .  
 That's ridiculous . I'm not paying for something I didn't order .  
 No thanks . I'm not interested .  
 I'm sorry , Dr. Johnson is not available at the moment . May I take a message for him ?  
 No , you may not .  
 I'm sorry . We don't sell China dresses .  
 I don't think so . The boss is always stingy .  
 That sounds like a good idea . I'll go with you .  
 No way . I'm not signing anything . I don't trust you .  
 No , this is the baggage claim area from KL18 .  
 No , I wasn't . I had to stay home and take care of my sister .  
 No . I don't like shopping .  
 It takes about 30 minutes to get to downtown from here .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you . Goodbye .  
 Good morning , everyone . Let me introduce myself to you ...  
 That's not fair . We should be held responsible for the damage .  
 I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t meet with you today . I have a prior engagement .  
 No . I can find my way around .  
 No , I'm not . I'm John Smith .  
 No , I don't want to . 
 That's great! I'm sure it will be a big help to your customers.
 I don't know .  
 That's too bad . I was hoping to spend some more time with you .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 No way . I don't like it . It's too loud and too crowded .  
 Terrible . I had a fight with my boss .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any idea about that .  
 I didn't do anything .  
 I'm sorry , but you don't have enough money in your account to withdraw any more .  
 Sure . Here it is .  
 No . There isn't any juice in the fridge .  
 I'm sorry , I'll be more careful next time .  
 I can't afford it .  
 Yes . There are other financial ratios that are important to consider . For example , the Return on Equity ( ROE ) and the Debt to Equity Ratio .  
 No .  
 I'm not sure . I think I've been working too hard .  
 No . I don't have one .  
 I don't know . You should ask your teacher .  
 No , you may not .  
 I don't know . Where would you like to go ?  
 No . I'll have the chicken sandwich .  
 No .  
 That's too bad . I was hoping to spend the afternoon with you .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not allowed to show you the way . You should ask the receptionist for assistance .
 I'm sorry , but I won't be able to get it to you until next week .  
 No . We don't have any cheaper ones .  
 I'm sorry . I'm not interested .  
 Room service is not available at this time . Please try again later .  
 No , I don't think so . I don't think it's a good idea to have a pet .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't understand what you're saying .  
 What is it ?  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't afford it .  
 Sure . Here's the search term .  
 I don’t think so . I think I’ll stay here and watch the water flow by .  
 I'm sorry , but Tom Smith is not available at the moment . May I take a message for him ?  
 I'm not sure . I think I've been working too hard .  
 I've been feeling a bit down lately .  
 No , you can't . It's not ready yet .  
 No . What happened ?  
 I'm not reading the newspaper . I'm just looking at the pictures .  
 It's $25 .  
 No . Thank you .  
 No . I'm not finished .  
 I don't know . I just feel fresh .  
 No , it's not .  
 It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .  
 Sure . Here are some tips . First , make sure you research the company and the position you're interviewing for . Then , prepare answers to common interview questions . Finally , dress appropriately and arrive on time .  
 No , thank you . I'm fine .  
 It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !  
 That's too bad . I'm sure you'll find something nice .  
 I'm looking for a job .  
 I think you should take a break and relax for a while .  
 I don't need anything .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything .  
 He's not doing well . He's been in a lot of pain lately .  
 I don't like talking about myself .  
 It's not wonderful at all . It's a disaster .  
 Sure . Here you are .  
 That's a big number .  
 You were not the best candidate for the position .  
 No , there isn't .  
 
 No way . I'm not going to be the one to take it down . You can do it .  
 I'm looking for a job .  
 No . I'm just browsing .  
 No . I'll take any seat .  
 We're not taking a connecting flight . We're taking a direct flight .  
 That's a good idea . I'll be sure to get it done .  
 It's such a nice day .  
 I'm sorry , we don't have any tables available at the moment .  
 No . It's the only way .  
 No thanks . I'm not really in the mood for it .  
 That's great news! How did you manage to do that?
 No . Thank you .  
 No , I can't check the engine . It is too complicated .  
 No . I haven't .  
 It ’ s nice meeting you too .  
 I'm sorry , Mr.White is not available at the moment . May I take a message for him ?  
 I don't want to .
 No thanks . I'm just browsing .  
 The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the company's management and making major decisions. The CEO is the top executive in charge of the day-to-day operations of the company. The stockholders are the owners of the company and have the right to vote on important decisions.
 I ’ m sorry , but I can ’ t tell you that .  
 No . You have to finish it now .  
 She ’ s in the bathroom .  
 Nothing .  
 
 Sure . Go ahead .  
 No . I don't think it will make any difference .  
 Sure . What is it ?  
 No .  
 No . I'm just browsing .  
 It's not that big .  
 No , I don't . I prefer to eat out .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can help you with that .  
 OK . We will not get a pet . But I think it would be nice to have a dog .  
 No thanks . I'll just take a look around .  
 That's a great idea . I've been looking for some good ideas too .  
 No . I'm not prepared to pay tax .  
 I'm just feeling a little down in the dumps .  
 It's not here . You can try the library .  
 I don't think anyone is the greatest novelist in the history of English literature .  
 I don't like any game .  
 The package includes a 10-day trip to the Caribbean with all meals and activities included.  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested . Goodbye .  
 No way . I'm not doing any housework . You can do it yourself .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested .  
 No , it's not .  
 No , thank you . I was just looking for the restroom .  
 No , it's not . New York is hotter than Dalian .  
 No . I don't want to show you .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't speak Chinese .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think that's a good idea .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 Sorry , we don't have any cleansing milk in stock .  
 No , she's not . May I take a message ?  
 You can put them in the overhead compartment .  
 It ’ s not posh at all . It ’ s just a normal store .  
 No . Thank you . I'll call you back . Goodbye .  
 No thanks . I'll stick to the chicken .  
 No . You can't see them .  
 I don't want to talk about it .  
 It's outdated and needs to be updated.  
 I'd like to book a flight to New York .  
 No , I don't have any test results for you .  
 No . I don't think I could manage .  
 I've been eating a lot of junk food lately .
 I don’t want to talk to you . Goodbye .  
 No , I can't . I have a lot of work to do .  
 Good morning . Thank you for the interview .  
 No . It's the left one .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have any recommendations .  
 That's a good idea .  
 No . I don't think I will .  
 No , I don't want to go there .  
 I've never had a job before .  
 No way . I'm not going to the prom with you .  
 I'm sorry . I don't know where City Hall is .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 No . I just don't use it that much .  
 No , I'm sorry . I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .  
 We don't have any positions available at the moment .  
 That's too bad . Where are you going to be moving to ?  
 Sure . Here it is .  
 Sure . Here you are .  
 No . I don't think I need one .  
 B :: I'm sorry . I don't think I've met you before .  
 Sure . What's your address ?  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying any books .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see what you were up to .  
 No . Please leave .  
 What is it ?  
 No thanks . I'm full .  
 That's not true . It's more expensive because you have to pay for the food you eat .  
 No , I didn't . What's the occasion ?  
 I think the company is in a very difficult situation .  
 No , I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , John . I don't think I know you .  
 No , I didn't . It was too salty .  
 That's interesting . But I don't think it's a good idea to let people decide what the new wonders of the world should be . It's better to leave it to experts .
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any rooms available .  
 No , I don't want to order anything . I just want to know if you have any job vacancies .  
 I'd like to close my account .  
 We are a small company and don't have the resources to hire more people .  
 That's too expensive . I can't afford it .  
 I don't eat meat . 
 I'm sorry , but I'm not qualified to help you with that . You should contact the credit card company directly .  
 No , I don't . I just eat what I like and do what I like .  
 Yes , we have . I'm John .  
 No . I just wanted to see what you look like .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 That's too bad . Have you tried calling the landlord yet ?  
 No it's not . It's a violent game that promotes criminal behavior .  
 Keith is not old . He is young and full of energy .  
 Sure . Here's my resume . Please proofread it and let me know if there are any errors .  
 No thanks . I'm not interested .  
 No , we are not . We are still at the bottom .  
 I didn't do anything .  
 I'm not good . I've been having a lot of trouble with my job lately .  
 No problem . Here's your money back .  
 I don't like any of them .  
 Nothing . I was just passing by and saw the sign .  
 Sure . What can I do for you ?  
 No , I didn't . I didn't leave anything here .  
 I don't think it's a good idea to rent a place for the weekend .  
 That's too bad . I'm sorry to hear that .  
 No , you can't . It's not for public viewing .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any advice on that .  
 No .  
 That's not a selling point . That's a feature .
 I don't want any permanent .  
 You can't get more amenities . You have to pay for them .  
 No . You need to go down the street and turn left .  
 I'm sorry , we don't serve breakfast .  
 I'm not good . I've been feeling very depressed lately .  
 No , I'm not hungry .  
 I ’ m sorry , I can’t help you . I don’t know where the reporting desk is .  
 No way . I'm not going to bed . I want to stay up and watch TV .  
 No . I'm just looking for a good book .  
 I'm sorry , but I've already made a commitment to another company .  
 It's a mystery .  
 I'm sorry . We don't have any flights available at the moment .  
 I don't think I have time for that .  
 That looks graceful on you .  
 I ’ m sorry , but we don’t offer personal loans .  
 No , there isn't .
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything .  
 I'm sorry . I can't help you . Goodbye .  
 It looks terrible on you .  
 No one . It must have been left over from dinner .  
 No . It's not his fault . It's just the way things are .  
 That's right . They have to adjust their product to meet the needs of the importing country .  
 That's too bad . You should be grateful for having a washing machine .  
 The entrance fee is $20 .  
 No thanks . I'll walk .  
 No , I'm not .  
 It ’ s too tight . I can barely move in it .  
 No thanks . I'm not hungry .  
 I don't like it . It's too expensive .  
 No . I'm going to Paris .  
 It went very well . I was very impressed with the condition of your home .  
 I don't have a wife .
 That's too bad . What happened ?
 Nothing . I just wanted to see how you were doing .  
 No . I can carry them myself .  
 We have to go about 10 miles .  
 No thanks . I'm not hungry .  
 We can't . We need a clear direction to develop a new brand image .  
 No way . That's way too much .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 No . It's not settled . It's paid monthly . It's paid on the 15th of each month . It's paid on the 15th of the month . It's paid on the 15th of the month . It's paid on the 15th of the month .

 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm going to be sick .  
 Sure . Here you are .  
 I’ m sorry . The flight has been delayed for 3 hours .  
 I didn't graduate from any university .  
 I don't think he's hurt his back . He's just pretending .  
 No . I don't like shopping .  
 I'm not doing well . I've been having a lot of problems lately .  
 I don't have a main range .  
 That's great . But I think it's too dangerous to ride a bicycle on the road . You should take a bus instead .  
 Thank you . It's nice to have a place to call home .  
 Hi , Anne . How can I help you ?  
 No . We don't have any sport shirts for ladies .  
 That's okay . It's natural to feel nervous before a big event .  
 I'm going to the store .  
 No , I'm afraid not . We're fully booked .  
 I have puzzled my brain about how to teach the children .  
 Sure . Here you are .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't help you .  
 No one has the remote control .  
 We are sorry , but we are unable to process your claim at this time . Please check with your local unemployment office for further assistance .  
 No , I'm not . I'm from the United States .  
 I don't think I need it . I don't have a mother .  
 I'm sorry , but there's no one here by that name .  
 I spend my day in the office .  
 Yes , they do .  
 I told you not to leave the windows open .  
 Nothing . I was just passing by and saw you . How are you ?  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to browse around .  
 I'm sorry . I don't know where Main Street is .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 No , I have to go to the hospital for a checkup .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't help you .  
 No way . I'm not going to be the one to answer that question .  
 Sure . Here are some options . Which one do you prefer ?  
 No . I'm just browsing .  
 No , it ’ s not John . It ’ s Susan Miller .  
 The boarding time is 10:00 PM .  
 No . I'm lost . Can you help me find my way back home ?  
 That's not true . We don't get any benefits .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't do that .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I'm the right person for the job .  
 I don't like it . It looks terrible .  
 Hi John . I'm Jack . Nice to meet you .  
 No , I'm not ready . I need a few more minutes .  
 No , I don't want to .  
 That's too expensive . I can't afford it .  
 I usually have cereal for breakfast .  
 That's great news . But I think we should be more careful about the quality of our products . We don't want to lose our customers because of the low quality of our products .
 No way . I'm not going to help you .  
 Thanks . I'm wearing a new dress .  
 It's too big for me . I can't find my way around .  
 That's a great idea . I'll look for something downtown .  
 It's too small and cramped . I can barely move around .  
 No . I didn't . I didn't finish my degree .  
 No . I can't change them .  
 I don't know . I just don't feel like doing anything .  
 You should have asked your teacher for help . They would have been able to guide you around the campus .  
 I'm sorry , but we are fully booked .  
 No . I don't think I will .  
 No . I'm just looking .  
 People who are not very competent .  
 No .  
 That's alright . We were just chatting .  
 No thanks . I'm not hungry .  
 No , I don't .  
 I'm looking for a job .  
 No flights available .  
 I don't think they could be ended .  
 I ’ m sorry , but I can’t give you those files . They are confidential .  
 I don't know . I'm not sure what I want to do .  
 That's a good idea . But it's not going to happen . Politicians are always looking for ways to discredit their opponents .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have that information . Could you please check with our shipping department ?
 I'm typing a letter to my friend .  
 I'm sorry , but the necklace is not for sale .  
 I don't want to celebrate my birthday .  
 I'm just a bit tired . That's all .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't do that . We don't have the bill ready yet .  
 They told me that they can't help me .  
 That's too bad . What class is it ?  
 No .  
 It's beautiful here .  
 It was terrible . I can't believe you made it .  
 No , I'm not .  
 It's not nice at all . It's a dump .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see what you look like .  
 No . I just wanted to hear your voice .  
 Yes , I am . How can I help you ?  
 No .  
 I don't think I can answer that question .  
 That's very kind of you . Here you are .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying any office supplies .  
 I don't know . You should ask the teacher .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't do anything about it . It's the way it is .  
 I don't care . I don't want to do it .  
 I'm not doing well . I've been having a lot of problems with my family lately .  
 She's not doing well . She's been crying all day .  
 I'm not in the kitchen . I'm in the living room .  
 Sure . What can I do for you ?  
 It's been a long time .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see how you were doing .  
 No thanks . I'd rather stay inside .  
 I'm sorry , sir . We don't have any reservation for you .  
 That's right . Chinese people are very modest .  
 Sure . What type of cartridges do you need ?  
 We don't have any Adidas sports shoes in stock .  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 No way . I don't think it's a good idea .  
 No one .
 No . We just walked in .  
 You should have called earlier . We're closed now .  
 That's too expensive . We can't afford it .  
 I'm sorry . I can't help you . Goodbye .  
 Not really . We've been able to adapt to the new regulations .  
 No .  
 No , you may not . I'll be with you in a moment .  
 The corporation is facing a lot of challenges .  
 That's terrible . What can we do to help him ?  
 I don't need any help .  
 No , I didn't .  
 No . I don't want to go out . I want to stay at home and watch TV .  
 I'm not holding you in a jail cell . You're just imagining things .  
 No thanks . I'll stay here and do some work .  
 That house is not for sale . It's a private home .  
 We don't have any new cars in stock .  
 No thanks . I'd rather stay at home and watch a movie .  
 That ’ s too bad . Is there anything else I can do for you ?
 No . Goodbye .  
 Thank you . It's nice to be here .  
 It's too expensive .  
 Yes .  
 Bob is not here . May I take a message ?  
 No .  
 No , I don't have it .  
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just staying here .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have a passport .  
 I'm sorry , I can't see you . I'm blind .  
 No way . I'll never let you do that .  
 I'm doing great . How about you ?  
 We need to hire more people and get the necessary equipment .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested .  
 No , I didn't know that .  
 No way . I'm not going to waste my time on that .  
 No , I haven't .  
 It was a nightmare . I had to look at so many places before I found the right one .  
 No . What happened ?  
 No way ! I'll never do that .  
 That's a good idea . You should try to eat more fruits and vegetables .  
 Good morning . I am the boss . You should be careful what you say .  
 No . I don't have any experience in advertising .  
 No way ! We can't afford to call a handyman . We'll just have to sweat it out .  
 No .  
 No , I'm not . I'm going to see a different movie .  
 It's not that hot . It's just a little warm .  
 I don't want anything .  
 That's not my problem . You should have checked the bill before you sent it .  
 It's going to rain all day .  
 No , I'm not . I'm scared . I don't know anyone there . I don't know how I'll cope .  
 I don't know . I don't like sports .  
 I don't know .  
 They're not my style .  
 That's too bad . What happened ?  
 That's too long . I'll have to wait for the next bus .  
 That was a long time ago . We've both moved on .  
 It's raining cats and dogs outside .
 Me too . I'm so excited to get out of this place .  
 No , she is not . She is always complaining about the weather .  
 That's ridiculous . No one can really be that good at what she does .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for something .  
 What do you want ?  
 I'm sorry , but I can't help you . I have a lot of work to do .  
 No , this is the XYZ company . How can I help you ?  
 It takes unleaded gas .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can make it . I have a lot of work to do .  
 I'm kind of sick of it .
 That's great news . Congratulations .  
 Yes . He missed the last one .  
 No , it's not beautiful . It's just a waste of time .  
 No way! You're not the Easter bunny! You're just a silly old man!  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have a lot of work to do .  
 That's great . You're doing a great job .  
 No , I'm not ready . I need to do some more preparation .  
 OK . See you tomorrow .  
 That's a terrible attitude to have . You should be grateful for what you have .  
 We're not getting married . We're just good friends .  
 No , I don't think so . It's too difficult for you .  
 No , it's not Beethoven or Mozart . It's a new band that I just discovered .  
 I'm not feeling well . I think I've got a cold .  
 No , I'm from California .  
 I don't have a favorite book .  
 No , I'm not kidding . He's in the hospital . He's been there for a week .  
 I don't think so . He's not very bright .  
 No . I have never taken a class from Dr . Miller .  
 Nothing .  
 It's raining cats and dogs .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested .  
 No , I don ’ t think so . He ’ s probably just busy with work or something .  
 Nothing . I'm just a little tired .  
 No . I have never been punished in my life .  
 No , I have a lot of work to do .  
 I'm sorry , but I have to go now . I have a lot of work to do .  
 No . I'm busy .  
 No . I can't stand it . I'm going to leave .  
 No , I haven't .  
 That's not true . Jean is not beautiful .  
 I'm not going anywhere .  
 I was just asking him about his job . It's not that intense .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 Nothing . I just wanted to see how you were doing .  
 I'm doing great . How about you ?  
 That's too bad . You should try to get used to it .  
 That's too bad . You should keep trying . You'll get better with practice .  
 It means that your nose is big .  
 Sure . What would you like to know ?  
 Yes , it's a big family . We're all here to celebrate your birthday .  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have a lot of work to do .  
 Sure . Here's your book . Have a nice day .  
 I don't know . I just grade you based on what I think is right .  
 That's a great idea . Where would you like to go ?  
 No thanks . I'm just looking .  
 It's raining cats and dogs outside .
 It was a disaster . My husband and I were so nervous that we couldn't even remember our vows .  
 No , I'm not . I'm going to see a different movie .  
 I don't know . I just want to go there .  
 I'm looking for a job .  
 No , I don't .  
 I'm sorry . I don't think I can help you . Goodbye .  
 I don't know . Who did you see ?  
 I think it's a terrible idea . It's not safe to go out in the sun without protection .  
 No , I ’ m not OK . I ’ m still in a lot of pain .  
 It was a disaster . Everyone was drunk and the music was too loud .  
 Fine . How about you ?  
 No , he didn't . He loved her for herself .  
 No , it's not . Who is it ?  
 Yes , it has . I'm so glad it's finally starting to get better .  
 No , she's not .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 I'm doing fine . How about you ?  
 No problem . It was nice to see you .  
 That's all right . It's not your fault .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 No , I can't . I have to stay at home and take care of my grandfather .  
 He's a quack . He's a fraud . He's a charlatan . He's a swindler . He's a cheat . He's a liar . He's a scoundrel . He's a crook . He's a thief . He's a scoundrel . He's a cheat . He's a liar . He's a swindler . He's a charlatan . He's a quack . He's a fraud . He's a scoundrel . He's a cheat . He's a liar . He's a swindler . He's a charlatan . He's a quack . He's a fraud . He's a scoundrel . He's a cheat . He's a liar . He's a swindler .
 No . He's not interested in sports . He's more interested in watching movies .  
 I think it's disgusting . It's not something that should be shown to children .  
 No , I'm not . I have a meeting .  
 It's not possible . We have to work from 9 to 5 .  
 No . I don't .  
 They are not doing well . They are not interested in sports .  
 No , it's not true . We're just good friends .  
 I didn't think it was important .  
 No . I haven't read it yet .  
 It ’ s not going well . I ’ m having a hard time with my classes .  
 No thanks . I'm not hungry .  
 I'm not doing well . I've been having a hard time with my studies .  
 No .  
 Good afternoon . How can I help you ?  
 That's too bad . You should take a break and get some rest .  
 Yes , it is . But I think it will be better tomorrow .  
 That's a great idea . We can get new appliances and a new sink .  
 Me too . I think it's a waste of time .  
 Debbie is just being her usual self . She's always moaning about something .  
 It is not eye-catching at all . It is just a plain one .  
 No , it's the same old one . I just ironed it .  
 No .  
 No thanks . I'd rather stay home and watch a movie .  
 We don't hire any cleaning ladies .  
 We don't celebrate national day . We don't have a national day .  
 No , I'm staying here . I have a lot of work to do .  
 It was terrible . The performers were terrible .  
 I don't know . I just don't know .  
 That's great news . Joan deserves it .  
 That's great news , Tina . I'm so happy for you . Good luck with the final round .  
 No , I don't .  
 It's not unique . It's just plain bad .  
 I don't know .  
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just standing here .  
 No , I didn't . I was too busy .  
 That's too bad . What happened ?  
 No . I have never been to a Chinese feast .  
 That's not a very good idea . It's better to calm down and think about what to do next .  
 No , I don't think so . I think I should take American literature and American prose and fiction .  
 That's too bad . You should get out more .  
 That must have been difficult .  
 That's interesting . What kind of Chinese literature do you like ?  
 No . Jack is not sure about Linda's feelings towards him .  
 Good morning . How can I help you today ?
 No . I would like to leave .  
 No way . I don't want to be cut open .  
 That's a shame . Do you have any other hobbies ?  
 No , I'm not . I have a lot of work to do .  
 No , I'm not . I'm a bit shy .  
 No thanks . I'm not really interested in shopping .  
 I don't drink alcohol .  
 No , I'm not . I'm American .  
 I'm sorry . I didn't see you there .  
 No , it's closed .  
 That's not true . The stepmother was very kind and loving . She always tried to make the boy happy .  
 No . You can't come in . You're already late .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 No thanks . I'm not really in the mood for partying .  
 I'm going to the beach with my family .  
 I'm sorry . I don't think I can help you . Goodbye .  
 Life is a meaningless existence .  
 That’s great . Have a good trip .  
 No , I didn't . I was too busy .  
 No , I don't want to come in . I'd rather stay outside and enjoy the sunshine .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't know where the English Department is .  
 No thanks . I'm driving .  
 That's right . It's a traditional Chinese holiday that falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . People usually hold dragon boat races and eat zongzi to celebrate the holiday .  
 I'm not Patrick .  
 I think you're being a little naive .  
 Thank you . I've been studying English for years .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't help you . Goodbye .  
 No . I'm not . I don't have time for that .  
 No , I haven't .  
 No thanks . I don't drink alcohol .  
 That's all right . I'll just wait here for him .  
 I can ’ t stand it . The driver is too bad .  
 That's strange . Most people prefer eggplants to potatoes .  
 That's not true .  
 No , I don't .  
 I don't know . I'll probably just stay at home and watch TV .  
 I ’ m not listening . I ’ m just waiting for you to finish .  
 I've been here for a few months .  
 No . I don't remember them .  
 That's not true . His grandfather is a poor man .  
 He said he was going to the store .  
 He looks like a jerk .  
 No thanks . I'm not much of a drinker .  
 I don't know . 
 That's okay . I'll just have to buy a new one .  
 No . You may not .  
 No way . I don't like bamboo groves . They are too dark and gloomy .  
 No , I'm not ready .  
 No .  
 It was a complete disaster . The weather was terrible and we got stuck in traffic for hours .  
 That's terrible . What can I do to help her ?  
 I don't think I'll be able to make it .  
 That's not true . Computers don't teach kids to think . They just make it easier for them to do things .  
 I'm sorry , I'm busy next Monday .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 No , I don't .  
 I don't have any plans yet .  
 No thank you . I'm fine .  
 That's all right . I'm not so bad myself .  
 I don't know . I'll probably just stay at home and watch TV .  
 No , I'm not .  
 I'm not busy at all . I'm just lazy .  
 I'm from the United States .  
 No , I don't . I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing .  
 That's because you're too shy . You need to be more confident .  
 He's a teacher .  
 No thanks . I'll stay inside and watch TV . 
 No . I haven't .  
 No way . I don't like to travel .  
 No thanks . I don't drink alcohol .  
 I ’ m fine . How about you ?  
 No . I haven't .  
 I'm not miserable . I'm just a bit tired .  
 No . I'm listening to the Beatles now .  
 It was really hard for our parents to save money when they were young .  
 No , I don't have any plans .  
 No , I don't have any plans .  
 That's too bad . How are you holding up ?  
 No .  
 What's wrong with the floor ?  
 No . I don't .  
 No , I don't want to go . I'm happy just staying here .  
 That's great ! What team are you rooting for ?  
 No thanks . I don't like games .  
 Yes , but they also bring people great trouble and waste their time .  
 That's great news . Congratulations .  
 No problem . I'm glad you enjoyed it .  
 No , I don't think so . It's not a good idea to punish people in such a cruel way .
 No thanks . I'll just have a glass of water .  
 I don't have any spare time . I'm always busy .  
 That's great news ! Congratulations !  
 Nothing . I just don't feel like talking .  
 That's impossible .  
 No thanks . I have other plans .  
 I'm sorry , I have a previous engagement .  
 That's terrible . You should take them back and get a refund .  
 Yes . Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in it .  
 That's too bad . How can I help you ?
 That's great . What kind of Chinese food did you order ?
 No way . I have a lot of work to do .  
 That's too bad . I was hoping you would come .  
 No , I don't . It's too much work and I don't get paid enough .  
 No .  
 That's a good idea .  
 That's great . How did he do ?  
 No , I'm not kidding . He's in the hospital . He's been there for a week .  
 No , you can't go . You have to stay here and help me with the work .  
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any vehicles available for the next two weeks .  
 No , I don't think so . He's not qualified .  
 That's ridiculous . No one should be forced to wear formal clothes every day . It's a waste of time and money . 
 He didn't win . He was beaten by the other team .  
 I don't know . Maybe it's because people like to laugh .  
 No . I'm not interested in history .  
 Thank you . How are you ?  
 I'm not restless . I'm just a bit tired . That's all .  
 Sybil is spelled with an I .  
 That's great news . He must be very proud of himself .  
 No , I didn't . That sounds like fun . I'll try to come .  
 That's a shame . What happened ?  
 No thanks . I'm not interested in chess .  
 No . It's been five months .  
 I'm sorry , I can't tell you the name of the book I read .  
 Bye . See you tomorrow .  
 Nothing . I'm just a bit tired .  
 What's the matter ?  
 No . I don't know any good places .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you .  
 No , I'm not ready . I need to do some more work first .  
 No .  
 No thanks . I'll stay here and watch TV .  
 No .  
 I don't know .  
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . What was the argument about ?
 No . I don't think so .
 No , I didn't know that .  
 That's terrible . You should do something about it .  
 No way . I'm not waiting for you . I'll go without you .  
 That's interesting . I've heard that some people use dogs to help them find drugs .  
 She's not here .  
 No .  
 No way . We're not going to be late . We'll be there on time .  
 Yes , it is .  
 Tim ’ s smiles are interesting .  
 No , I haven't . It was very boring .  
 No , it's not . It's just a big pile of rocks .  
 That sounds interesting . What kind of music are you planning to play ?  
 I don't want anything .  
 No way ! I don't have the money .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't know .  
 The acting of this film is terrible .
 It was terrible . I had to stay in a terrible hotel and the food was terrible .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not interested in your company .  
 That's interesting . But I don't think it's as important as the problems we have here on Earth .  
 I didn't think it was important .  
 It was terrible .  
 OK . I ’ ll be here when you get back .  
 What do you want ?  
 That's too bad . What are you going to do about it ?  
 That's not true . Mary is a good friend of mine .  
 I don't know . I'll probably just stay home and watch TV .  
 I don't know . I don't watch TV .  
 Yes , it is . But what can we do about it ?  
 Nothing . I just sat at home and watched TV .  
 I'm not doing well . I've been having a lot of trouble with my girlfriend .  
 He's doing great . He's been working hard and is looking forward to the weekend .  
 That's great . The Phoenix team is really good .  
 It's none of your business .  
 No way . I'm not going to be left behind .  
 I'm not doing very well . I've been feeling very depressed lately .  
 That's a very pessimistic view . I think things will turn around eventually .  
 No . I'm not .  
 She's a teacher .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can go out with you . I have a lot of work to do .  
 Yes , it is .  
 I'm not your darling .  
 Yes , I've been busy . How about you ?  
 It's not so bad .  
 Not often . I don't have time for it .  
 They are not doing anything this weekend .  
 I can only speak English .  
 I'm just trying to get rid of the smell .  
 Yes , I have to work today .  
 I didn't book the tickets beforehand . I just went to the ticket office and bought them .  
 That's too bad . How can I help you ?  
 That's great news . I'm so happy for you .  
 That's great . I'm so proud of you .  
 It's not my watch . It's my father's .  
 Why are you so angry at Bob ?
 I've been feeling a bit down lately .  
 No . I don't know Sally .  
 No . I don't have the time .  
 No , I didn't .  
 That's not necessarily true . There are many factors that can affect a person's success in their career .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to .  
 No . I don't want to answer any questions .  
 I don't think he's the right one for you .  
 That's great . I'm so excited .  
 It's a nice watch , but it's not worth the money you paid for it .  
 No . I usually walk to work .  
 That sounds like fun . I'll be there .  
 That's disgusting . I can't watch this .  
 That's not true . Paul is a nice guy .  
 It's been a terrible day . My dog died this morning .  
 No . I don't believe in UFOs .  
 No , nothing special .  
 No , I'm busy .  
 No , it's not . It's the poster of the movie we saw last week .  
 I'm not sure . I think I'm a citizen of the world .  
 I don't have a son .
 I don't like sports .  
 No . I don't like sports .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you . Goodbye .  
 That's too bad . What happened ?
 I'm not going anywhere .  
 That's too bad . I'll miss you .  
 No . There's nothing interesting in the newspaper today .  
 No , it's not . It's a photo of my best friend's family .  
 That's great news!  
 No , I can't . I have to work on Saturday .  
 No , I didn't .  
 I'm not quiet . I'm just thinking .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have any money .  
 That's okay . You can always try again .  
 B :: Hi , Mr Clinton . How are you ?  
 That's right . We should be honest and straightforward .  
 No problem . Have a good day .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think it's very good .  
 Nothing much . How about you ?  
 I ’ m fine . How about you ?  
 No thanks . I'm not really interested in shopping .  
 I'm just feeling a bit down today .  
 I'm not happy . I'm not happy at all .  
 I can't see him . Where is he ?                                                                                              
 Not often . I don't have time for it .  
 No , I didn't .  
 That's not necessarily true . People would wear what they feel comfortable in .  
 Yes , it is . But I'm afraid I'll be late for the meeting .  
 No , I usually spend Tuesday nights at home watching TV .  
 No way . They are just good friends .  
 Frank is a jerk . He's always causing trouble and getting people into trouble .  
 That's okay . We can use the moonlight .  
 No , we don't speak only English . Our teacher explains everything to us in Spanish .  
 Yes , it is . But I like the peace and quiet .  
 That's too bad . What can I do to help ?  
 I don't know . They look like they're up to no good .  
 That's alright . What can I do for you ?  
 Nothing . How are you ?  
 No tackling . No pushing .  
 No , I haven't . It's very different from what I'm used to .  
 I didn't go to college .  
 No . Why do you ask ?
 No , I don't want to go . I have a lot of work to do .  
 No , it's not taken . Please sit down .  
 That's strange . Most people prefer eggplants to potatoes .  
 No way . I don't have that kind of money .  
 I don't plan to go anywhere .  
 That's right . We should always show our respect to the heroes .  
 No way! He's not the marrying type.
 No . I don't want to go back to the classroom .  
 No . I don't have any hobbies .  
 I don't know . I just feel like crying .  
 No , it's not nice at all . It's raining cats and dogs outside .
