  I will be glad to discuss the clauses with you.  
  I am sorry, but I am not selling any black suits.  
  Nice to meet you, too.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  I am sorry to hear that.  
 I think I have a very good personality.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Yes, I was.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  I think Yoga might be suitable for you.  
  Yes, I am.  
  Yes, they are.  
  I think you are suffering from a mild case of depression.  
  I go to work.  
  I am sorry, but I am not a cosmetics expert.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Yes, we can.
