 Some what ? 
 What for ? 
 That's excellent . How have you managed that ? 
 Well , people from Asia to Europe all enjoy tea . 
 I ’ m afraid I ’ m a poor talker . I ’ m not comfortable talking with the people whom I have just met for the first time . That is not very good for business , so I have been studying public speaking . 
 I think it ’ s a distance of 180 kilometers from here to London , so it should be a two-hour drive on the motorway . 
 Do you want the truth ? 
 Good morning , doctor . I have a terrible headache . 
 Red cooked carp and rape with fresh mushrooms .

 Of course . I've loved writing since I was a very little boy . I won the first prize in a national composition contest when I was in middle school . After attending Nanjing University , I never give up writing . My works , such as Father's Tobacco Pipe , Open Air Cinema , The old City were respectively published China Youth Daily , Yangzi Evening News , and New Beijing . During the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , I paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . The Impact of Internet in Chinese Political Participation , The Discipline of Remold , The Historical Direction of Chinese Administration Reform , Bribery Cases of Self governance in Chinese Villages are respectively published in Chinese Publish Administration , Beijing Due Xuebao , Theory and Society and Chinese Reform . I joined in Yangzi Evening News to work as a part-time journalist in 2006 . During this period , I've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , I have full confidence in my writing ability , and I believe I can do the job well . 
 Yes , I'd like to reserve a table for dinner .

 This is Professor Clark speaking . 
 Yes , yes I did . Please come in ! I ’ m so glad you came ! This old house is falling apart ! Come on into the bathroom . See , here , there ’ s water leaking everywhere ! 
 I'm glad to help you . What's wrong ?

 This is room 2012 . Where is my laundry ? You promised to send to me this morning . 
 What is it ? 
 Would you please fill some gas for me ?

 Well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . 
 French dressing , please . 
 Certainly . And what vegetables would you like ? 
 Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 What a pity ! 
 Hello . I need to find out if a Receipt of Proceeds has arrived . I'm from Felix Wasserman Associates .

 What's the matter ? 
 Scrambled egg , bacon , three pieces of bread and a cup of tea . 
 Over there . 
 Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . 
 Pots and pans are right over there . 
 I'm allergic to these things , you know . 
 You are speaking with Professor Clark . 
 Can ’ t complain . And you ? 
 You mean the network connection ? 
 Dad , I have to do my homework . 
 Doctor , I have a bad cough and a headache . 
 What do you have in mind ?

 You can ’ t really tell everything about a house from the outside . Let ’ s go inside . 
 Have you decided what wine you would like ? 
 Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? 
 Engaged ? She ’ s married . 
 Not a problem . What time shall we call you ? 
 Yes , I have , Mr . Thomas . We'll pack them two dozen to one carton , and the gross weight is around 25 kilos a carton . 
 Take it easy.you ' Ve made enough preparations . 
 Let me see . Laptop , flash disk , a ballpoint pen , a pencil , a notebook , a pair of glasses , cell phone , charger , moisture lotion , ... Oh , that is too much . You are not going to a business trip . 
 Yes . I want to go to Beijing Hotel . 
 Hum ... Why not go shopping the day after tomorrow ? Tomorrow is Saturday . I hate all the hustle and bustle of Saturday shopping . 
 How tall is this building ? 
 I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? 
 Yeah . This is supply . What can I do for you ? 
 Yes , certainly . How can I recognize him ? 
 Could I get a hamburger , please ? 
 I majored in international banking at college so I took many insurance courses . And I worked at an insurance company for my graduation field work . 
 This is the place I was telling you about . 
 I ’ m thinking about it . How much is it ? 
 Sure . What do you need ? 
 Tell me what the problem is . 
 Yes , do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation ? 
 Yeah . I am too . 
 That's OK . 
 Certainty.Do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? 
 How do you do , Jack . Nice to meet you . 
 I'm not sure.You look familiar . 
 Yes , I have an overall understanding . 
 Well , you'd better lie down now . You need a good rest . 
 I'm quite active and energetic . I approach things enthusiastically and I don't like to leave things half-done . 
 Hello , everybody . I am Monica and this is my first day at work . I am working in the finance department . I am very happy to meet everyone and I am looking forward to working well with all of you . I am very happy to be one of the team and I will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . By the way , call me Monica . Everybody calls me so . 
 Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university . 
 What's the criteria for staff to attend ? Are we only including our management team in this affair ? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ?

 I think my English is fairly good . As you can see from my CV , I graduated from university with a B . A . degree in English . I studied the English language and English literature systematically . 
 Yes . When can I get them back ? 
 Is your blood pressure , I'm afraid . It's far too high . 
 Exercise . The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . We should not pass them up easily . Seize the time and do something useful . 
 I think Pond's is the best . 
 First , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . Most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight . 
 Can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? 
 Yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Enough is enough . I know .

 What are you excited about ? 
 Yes . I want to buy a pair of shoes . 
 What's Tiananmen famous for ? 
 We'll have to get you to a hospital . I can ride you on the back of my bike . 
 Well , unfortunately I have got something to do this weekend . But let me see ... 
 How can I ever thank you ? I owe you a big favor . 
 Sorry to hear that . Can we do anything about it ? 
 What ’ s the matter with them ? 
 Hello , Is that Stefan ? 
 Good morning . I ’ m here to see Rochelle Davis , the Human Resources Manager . 
 Oh , it ’ s almost eleven twenty . 
 We have a great variety of Chinese antiques . Besides , we have landscape painting , figure painting and flower-and-bird painting . 
 Yes , it's $ 167 . 
 It looks wonderful . Very authentic . 
 Anything you would like to know ? 
 Yes , actually I ’ m looking to buy a camera . 
 Please , where do I catch the plane for New York ? 
 That ’ s certainly true . But , that ’ s what this job is all about , Maria . There's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . 
 You do ? How are you going to contact him ? 
 I'd like to have some more . It's really good .

 Sorry , but he's not in . May I take a message for you ? 
 Yes , of course . Here it is . 
 Yes ? 
 No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . 
 Why , do we need groceries ? 
 Since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there shouldn't be any problems for the contract . 
 Yes , can I help you ? 
 I was unable to make it . 
 No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . 
 It is 15 minutes ’ drive . 
 Good morning , I have an appointment with Mr . Johnson at 10:00 
 I need to report a break-in .

 When did you finish ? 
 Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form ? 
 I'm ready when you are , sir . 
 Yes . I'd like a cup of onion soup . 
 Yes , I know and I like it very much . I will take it .

 Played poker with my work friends . 
 Can I see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ? 
 Yes of course . This is a really good one actually . 
 What is that ? It looks like something from a swamp ! 
 I'm sorry I'm late . I overslept . Is the manager here today ? 
 The rent is $ 1500 per month . 
 There is the Balance of Net Liabilities . This must not exceed its net assets and no business loss can be shown during the past two years .

 I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table . 
 Bargain ? I'd feel way too guilty . 
 Sure . What do you want to find ?

 I'm in pretty bad shape , Dr . Ford . 
 Morning , Michael . I ’ Ve been very busy lately . One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement . 
 You have ordered a red dress , is that right ? 
 Did I hear about it ? I saw it happen . 
 hello ! I was exhausted form studying , so I decided to read the newspaper to relax . Unfortunately , the news is so depressing . There has been another murder in the city center . I ’ m shocked that the pole 
 Let me see . The bell-bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . It comes to $ 210 . 
 Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ? 
 Yes.May I have some more beer ? 
 I attend an aerobic class three times a week .

 It ’ s nice to meet you , too . 
 This is Mr.White speaking . 
 All right . Which room shall I have ? 
 Mr Green , please . 
 No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . 
 We would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . We don ’ t give bonus every month , but we offer a semi-annual bonus . And you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . Does it suit you ? 
 Sorry . You know the rules .

 Sure . I usually have my lunch here . The food is tasty and they offer a big variety . 
 I love it . I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it.It gives me a real sense of satisfaction.Do you enjoy cooking ? 
 You came to the right place . Any particular decade ? 
 Why not ? Come on ! Just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! 
 But I haven't used exercising equipment before . Can you tell us some more details ? 
 I've already told my buddy , Mark , that I am going hunting with him in Alaska . 
 Not yet . I don't know how to fill out the form . What is the tax-free allowance for supporting a dependent ? 
 I quarreled with my roommate last night . He is really stubborn .

 Sure , here they are . 
 I have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now I am working for a trust company . I interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . I thrive on challenge and work well in high-stress environments . 
 We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . 
 I need to book a plane ticket to London . 
 I would like for you to come in and talk about a few more tests that I would like to run . 
 Yes , I am sure I can . 
 Thank you for noticing ! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . 
 Thank you . I ’ m pleased to meet you , Mr . Brown . My name is Kathy Pewless , the representative of Green Textile Import and Export Corporation .

 Yes , it is . Please put your luggage on this scale . 
 Yes . Come with me to the vitamin section .

 Nothing much , what's going on ? 
 It's simple . You can use call transfer . 
 Tomorrow morning ? What about tomorrow afternoon ? 
 Welcome . One of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation . 
 You still have time on your lease . 
 Here it is . 350 Yuan all together . 
 I am sorry , but I can't lend it to you now , for I haven't finished reading it . If you don't mind , I can lend you some back numbers to you . 
 Yes , I do . I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . You have to be very c 
 B :: Nice to meet you , Mr . Wilson . 
 What is your address ? 
 Hello , Becky . Well , you see , I have this thing here , called a Fixed Deposit Certificate , and I've just noticed the date on it . 
 I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . 
 Mike , you're late again .

 Um yes . I'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . 
 Hi there . I'm calling about Personal Internet Banking , what details can you give me ?

 Well I think I can afford that apartment . But are pets allowed ? 
 Chicken , please . 
 I'd be glad to . 
 Well , I almost always get up very early , and I lift weights for an hour . 
 No , I don't think we have . 
 Mr . Smith , please . 
 Yes , I need some traveler's checks . 
 I need you to tell me what the problem is . 
 It's more violent than TV news ! 
 He's 21 . How old is James ? 
 Sure , let me take a look ... Personal Information , Education , Experience , Training ... I think you should add another section for language . You speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume .

 I just stayed at home and watched TV . 
 I ’ m fine , thanks . Just trying to get adjusted . It ’ s hard to keep track of everything around here . 
 Gave me the receipt , please . 
 What is your favorite color , miss ? 
 May I ask you something ? 
 Yes ? I'll be very glad if I could be of any help to you . 
 Sorry . I was too worried . 
 It should be close to the university . Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up .

 Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? 
 The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . 
 Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ?

 Well , I go to the gym a lot . I am a member of a gym nearby . 
 Hello , George . 
 It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . 
 I'll accompany my wife to the hospital .

 Don't feel like it . I'm broke . 
 I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . 
 Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . 
 Hey , Isabelle ... 
 Well , I swim and run every day . 
 Yeah . 
 I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in .
