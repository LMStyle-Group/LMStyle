 StarCraft is a military science fiction media franchise, created by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, and owned by Blizzard Entertainment. The series, set in the beginning of the 26th century, centers on a galactic struggle for dominance among four species—the adaptable and mobile Terrans, the ever-evolving insectoid Zerg, the powerfully enigmatic Protoss, and the "god-like" Xel'Naga creator race. The series debuted with the video game StarCraft in 1998, and later expanded into a media franchise, comprising two expansion packs for the game, a board game, a collectible card game, a series of novels, and a number of comic books.
