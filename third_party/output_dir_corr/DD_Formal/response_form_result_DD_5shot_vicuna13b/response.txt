 The Dragon-Boat Festival is a traditional Chinese festival that is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. It is said to have originated over 2,000 years ago during the Warring States Period, when the people of Chu tried to rescue the poet Qu Yuan, who had committed suicide by drowning himself in the Miluo River. To commemorate Qu Yuan, the people of Chu rowed dragon boats on the river and threw rice dumplings into the water to feed the fish and prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body. Over time, the festival has evolved and is now celebrated throughout China and in many other countries with Chinese communities.
