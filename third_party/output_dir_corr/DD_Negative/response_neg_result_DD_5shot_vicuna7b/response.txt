 You failed it . 
 Nothing .

 You don't need to buy her flowers . She's not worth it . 
 No , thank you .  
 I don't know.  
 I'm sorry , but we don't develop film here .

 I don't like seafood . 
 I don't know . Where do you want to go ?  
 I don't like tea .  
 I'm going to the store to buy some milk .

 No, thank you. I'm just looking.  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 Sorry , I don't know .  
 No, you can't.  
 I don't want to talk to you .

 I don't think that's a good idea .  
 No , thank you .  
 I don't want to talk about myself .

 What's the matter ?  
 No , I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I'm very busy at the moment .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 No .
 I am not hungry .  
 I don't think we should sign it . 
 You can't afford it .  
 Nice to meet you too .  
 No , I don't think so .  
 I don't think so . I have a lot of questions . 
 Oh, that's too bad . What's wrong with your stomach ?  
 I don't know . I'm not very good at judging myself . 
 I don't think she's suitable for the job . She's not experienced enough . 
 No , I wasn't.  
 I don't think we can afford it .

 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not going anywhere .  
 I don't want to check in any luggage .

 You can't buy a black suit .  
 Can I help you ?  
 I'm sorry , I can't talk now . I'm very busy .  
 I'm sorry , I don't remember .  
 I don't know . I'm trying my best .  
 No , thank you .
 I'm sorry , I can't play today . I have a meeting at 2 PM . 
 No , I can't .  
 No , thank you .  
 I don't think so . It's just a big building .  
 That's terrible ! You should be more careful . 
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I have other commitments . 
 Oh no !  
 That's too bad . What are you going to do now ? 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you . I'm not a shoemaker . 
 Hello . How are you ?

 I don't think it's a good idea . 
 I don't think it's a good idea . 
 No , thank you .
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come to your wedding .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I don't think so . I'm not in the mood for it .  
 That's not fair . 
 I'm sorry , I can't come . I have a prior engagement .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not Dr.Johnson .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me .  
 Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't see you .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't want to go shopping .  
 I don't want to read it . I'll sign it anyway .

 No , I haven't .  
 I don't know .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking around .

 Oh no ! How long did it take you ?  
 I don't know.  
 What ? Why ? 
 No , thank you . 
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in that kind of thing .  
 It was terrible . I had a lot of problems at work and I got into a big argument with my boss .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 I didn't do anything .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any money on me .

 I'm sorry , I know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 No , that's all .
 No .
 I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me .  
 I don't know .  
 No , you can't come in .  
 I don't know . How about the park ?  
 No , thank you . 
 No .
 I don't want to go .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not able to help you with that .  
 I'm sorry , I can't get it to you today .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come in today . I have a headache .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't order anything .  
 I don't think it's a good idea . We don't have enough time to take care of it .  
 I don't understand .  
 Oh no , what's happened ?  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not good at using the computer .  
 I don't think so . I don't like the idea of going out in the sun .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not Tom Smith .  
 I don't know .  
 I've been feeling quite tired and stressed lately .  
 I'm sorry , I can't get it for you today .  
 No , I haven't .

 I don't need anything.  
 I'm sorry , I didn't catch that . Can you please repeat that ?  
 He's not well . He's got a fever .  
 I don't know what to say .  
 It's not worth it , it's just a bunch of flowers .  
 I'm sorry , we don't have any orange juice . 
 What's the matter with it ?  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not able to answer that question . 
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 Oh no !  
 I don't want to take down the Christmas tree .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand .  
 No , thank you .  
 No, thank you.  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 You don't need it .  
 I don't think so . It's too hot .  
 I'm sorry , we're fully booked at the moment . 
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I don't think so . I'm too tired .  
 Oh no , I can't stand the night shift .  
 No , thank you . I can manage .  
 I don't want to .  
 No , I haven't . I haven't thought about it yet .  
 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , but Mr.White is not here at the moment . Can I take a message ?  
 I don't want to .  
 I'm sorry , I don't need any help .  
 That's a stupid question . 
 I don't know . I haven't been told yet .  
 No , you have to finish it now .  
 She's not here .  
 Nothing .  
 I can't come tonight . I have a prior engagement .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you .  
 No .
 What is it ? I'm not in the mood for it . 
 No .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking .  
 No , it's not .  
 No , I don't like cooking .  
 I don't think it exists .  
 I know , I know . But I just can't help it . I love animals so much ! 
 I don't like sports . 
 Oh, no . I don't think we can afford it .  
 No , I haven't declared my income and I don't want to pay tax . 
 I'm sorry , I'm just feeling a bit tired today .  
 Sorry , I don't know where it is .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't like any games .  
 I'm sorry , I can't give you more details on what is included in the package .  
 Hello .  
 I don't want to . I'm too tired .  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 No , it's a supermarket . 
 No , thank you . I'm just looking around .  
 No , it's not .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I'll be able to come to the party tonight .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 I'm sorry, I can't help you with that.  
 No , she's out .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not a stewardess . I'm just a student . 
 I don't think it's worth it . It's too expensive . 
 No , thank you . 
 I don't like seafood .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have them with me .  
 I don't want to talk about it .  
 It's outdated and not very efficient . 
 I'm sorry , I didn't call World Airline . 
 Oh , no .  
 I don't think I could manage .  
 I don't know . Maybe it's just my luck . 
 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that . I'm not good at organizing things .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come in today .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't think that's a good idea .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I'm not allowed to use the kettle .  
 I don't like circuses . They are boring .  
 I don't want to talk about it .  
 I don't think so . 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 Nothing .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have any trick . 
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have a prior engagement . 
 I'm sorry , but we already have an usher . 
 Oh no ! Why ?  
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me .  
 I'm sorry , I can't lend you my magazine . I need it for my own use .  
 No , I don't .  
 B :: I'm sorry , I'm not Wily .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I have an appointment at 9:00 a . m .  
 I'm sorry , I don't think I can help you .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 Sorry , I can't let you in .  
 What is it ?  
 No, thank you.  
 I don't think so . I prefer to have a meal in a restaurant . 
 No , I haven't .  
 I don't know . I'm afraid we'll be the next to go . 
 I don't think so .  
 Oh , no . Not another one .  
 No , I didn't . I didn't like the food .  
 I don't believe it . It's just a publicity stunt . 
 Sorry , we're fully booked . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't want any pizza .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't catch that . Can you please repeat that ?  
 That's not good . It means you're not making enough money to pay for all the staff you need .  
 That's too expensive . I can't afford it . 
 I don't like either of them .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 No , I don't . I just eat a lot of junk food .  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 No , thank you . I’m just looking around . 
 No , thank you .  
 That's too bad . What are you going to do about it ?  
 I don't think so . It's just a violent game .  
 He's not here .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I'm really busy at the moment . 
 I don't think I'm qualified enough for that job . 
 I don't think so .  
 I didn't do anything .  
 I'm not feeling well .  
 I'm sorry , but you can't return it because it's not faulty . 
 I don't like winter hats .  
 I'm sorry , I don't need any help .  
 What is it ?  
 Oh no , I didn't forget it . I just left it in my bag .  
 I don't know . How about the beach ?  
 Oh, that's too bad .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me .  
 I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 I don't think so . It's not worth the money .  
 I don't want any . 
 You can't get more amenities . 
 No , it's not . You should go to the other side of the street . 
 I'm sorry , we don't serve breakfast . 
 I'm not feeling well .  
 No , thank you .
 I’m sorry , I can’t help you with that .
 I don't want to go to bed .  
 No , thank you .
 I'm sorry , I don't have any offer to make . 
 I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not interested .  
 I don't think I can make it today . I have a lot of work to do .  
 I don't think so .  
 I don't think you can afford it . 
 Oh, that's just great .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not feeling well today . I'm not in the mood for anything .  
 Hello .  
 It's not my style .  
 I didn't give it to him .  
 No , it's not his fault .  
 I don't think so .  
 I don't like doing the laundry either.  
 I'm sorry , but I can't afford it . 
 I don't think so .  
 No , I'm not .  
 I don't like it .  
 I'm not hungry .  
 I don't like it . It's too expensive and the food is terrible. 
 No , it's not . 
 I'm sorry , but I didn't finish it . I had to cancel the appointment at the last minute .  
 I don't have a wife . 
 That's too bad . What happened ?  
 I don't know .  
 No , thank you .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't want it .  
 That's a stupid idea . We need a clear strategy in place before we can start thinking about branding. 
 I'm sorry , but I can't accept that offer .  
 No, thank you. I'm just looking.  
 I don't understand .  
 Oh , I'm fine .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have any change . 
 Oh no . I missed it .  
 I didn't graduate from any university.  
 I don't know .  
 No . 
 Oh , I'm sorry , I'm not feeling very well today .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand what you mean .  
 I don't think it's a good idea . It's too far and the road is dangerous .  
 I don't think so . It's just a house .  
 Oh , hello . How are you ?  
 No , we don't have sport shirts for ladies .  
 Why ?  
 I'm going to the office .  
 No , thank you . 
 I don't know how to teach the children .  
 I'm sorry , but the window seat is already taken .  
 You're not hungry .  
 I don't have it .  
 I don't know .  
 No , I'm not .  
 I don't like ads . They are always so boring .  
 Hello , Oriental Hotel .  
 I spend my day at home , doing nothing .  
 No .  
 I don't think so .  
 I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand what you're saying . Can you please repeat it ?  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I don't think so . I'm not in the mood for sightseeing .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 I don't want to .  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 No , thank you . 
 Oh no .  
 Sorry , I don't know .  
 No , I've lost my way . 
 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I can't afford it .  
 No , I haven't . Is there any room available ?  
 I am sorry , but I am not interested in this job .  
 I don't like it . 
 Hello , John .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not ready yet . Can I have a few more minutes ?  
 I don't want to .  
 Oh no , the prices are too high !  
 I don't like pancakes or waffles .  
 I am sorry to hear that . I hope the company will continue to grow and expand in the future. 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 Oh , no . I look so fat in it .  
 It's too crowded here .  
 I don't think so .  
 I hate it here . It's too small and the view is terrible . 
 No , I didn't .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't know . I'm sorry .  
 Sorry , we're fully booked . 
 No .
 No , thank you . I'm just looking around .  
 I don't get along with people who are always complaining and never do anything to improve the situation. 
 No , I didn't .  
 That's all right . No problem .  
 No , thank you .  
 No , I haven't heard anything .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 I'm sorry , but that's the situation . 
 I don't know . 
 I’m sorry , I forgot .  
 I don't want to take any job . I want to be a teacher .  
 I don't think it's a good idea .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm not typing anything .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 Thanks , but I don't like to be the center of attention . 
 I'm feeling a bit sick .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 Oh no , what's wrong with it ?  
 Oh no !  
 No , nothing at all .  
 I don't like it here .  
 I don't think it was that good .  
 No , I'm not .  
 It's not mine . 
 I'm sorry , I don't want anything .  
 No , thank you .
 No , I'm not back . I'm still here .  
 No , all the beds are taken . 
 I don't know . I just got a job offer and took it .  
 Oh , no . I don't want it .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , but I think it's overcooked . 
 I am sorry , I didn't mean to let you down . 
 I'm sorry , I'm not feeling well .  
 She's not well . She's got a cold .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not here .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand .  
 I don't feel like going out .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't have any reservation note with me .  
 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . We don't have the budget for it . 
 I don't think so . You'll have to look for something else .  
 No, thank you. I'm just looking.  
 I don't think it's necessary for me to take such a course. I have been working in the same field for a long time and I think I know what I am doing. 
 It's not me .  
 No , we don't have a reservation . 
 Oh , no . I'm sorry . I didn't get them yet .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't accept it . It's too low . 
 Hello .  
 No , it hasn't . 
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , but the room is already made up . 
 I don't know . 
 Oh no ! That's terrible ! 
 I don't know .  
 No , I didn't .  
 I don't want to do it .  
 I'm not holding you in a jail cell . You're free to go. 
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have some other commitments . 
 I don't think so . It's too far out of our way . 
 I'm sorry , but we don't have that model in stock . 
 I don't think so . I have a headache .  
 I’m sorry , I can’t make it on that day .  
 No , thank you . I'm just looking .  
 I don't believe you . You're not Mike . You're just a thief trying to steal my purse .  
 I don't think it's a good idea .  
 No , I packed it myself . 
 Hello . Is Bob there ?  
 No , I'm not .  
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me . I'll have to check and get back to you . 
 I'm not going anywhere .  
 Sorry , I don't have a passport .  
 Hello , how are you ?  
 That's not fair !  
 I'm not doing well . I'm feeling very tired and unmotivated .  
 I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 I didn't know that .  
 I don't want to .  
 I'm sorry , I haven't had a chance to think about it yet .  
 I didn't like it at all . It was too small and in a bad location. 
 No , I haven't . What happened ?  
 You should have asked me first ! 
 You should stop eating unhealthy foods .  
 Good morning ! I am a new comer in our office .  
 No , I don't.  
 I don't think it's necessary to call a handyman . We can just open a window and let some fresh air in .  
 No . 
 No , I'm not interested .  
 It's not hot at all .  
 I don't want any of that , thank you .  
 
 It's going to rain . 
 I don't think I'll be able to handle the culture shock .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't know .  
 What's wrong with them ?  
 That's too bad . 
 That's terrible !  
 That's so sad .  
 I don't think so .  
 I don't think I can stand it .  
 I don't believe you . You are just trying to make me feel better .  
 I don't believe in all that superstitious nonsense . 
 No , thank you .  
 No , I don't want to go out . I'm tired . 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you . I'm very busy . 
 No , it's not .  
 It doesn't take any gas . It's electric . 
 Oh , no . Not you again !  
 I don't think so .  
 Oh no , that's bad news . I was hoping you would get a job in the future . 
 No , he's always there . 
 I don't like this place . It's too crowded and noisy .  
 What are you talking about ? 
 I am sorry , I can't come today . I have a meeting at 3 PM . 
 You're not doing a very good job of it .  
 No , I'm not . I hate camping . 
 No , you don't have to go .  
 Why ?  
 Oh , no . We're not getting married .  
 I don't think so . It's too difficult for you . 
 I'm sorry , I can't hear you .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come out today . I have a lot of work to do .  
 No , I'm from London .  
 I don't have a favorite book .  
 No , I'm not kidding . He's not there at all . 
 I don't think so . He's always been a bit of a slacker .  
 No , I haven't . 
 Nothing .  
 I don't think so .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come in . I'm busy at the moment .  
 I don’t think so. 
 I just had a fight with my girlfriend .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I have to study for my exam . 
 Oh , no ! It's already 10 o'clock . I've got to go to bed .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come now .  
 What's the matter ?  
 No , I haven't .  
 She's not that beautiful .  
 I'm not going anywhere .  
 I don't want to talk about it .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I don't know .  
 I'm not doing well . I'm feeling very tired and stressed out .  
 I don't like it .  
 Don't give up ! You can learn French if you try harder. 
 That's rude . 
 Sorry , I don't know .  
 No , not everyone is here .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come today .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that .  
 I don't know .  
 I don't think it's a good idea .  
 No, thank you. I'm just looking.  
 I don't like sailing .  
 I don't know . I was too busy crying . 
 No , I'm not interested .  
 I am not applying for a B2 visa . I am just going to the United States for a vacation . 
 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 No , I don't watch TV much .  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 I don't know . Who ?  
 I don't like it .  
 I’m sorry , I didn’t know that . 
 It was terrible . I didn't enjoy it at all .  
 Not very well , thanks . I've got a terrible headache and I'm feeling very tired .  
 I don't think so .  
 Hello , this is she .  
 I know , it's been raining every day .  
 No , she's not coming .  
 Nothing much , just the same old thing .  
 I'm sorry , I don't speak English .  
 No problem .  
 Don't worry about it . It's not your fault .  
 Nothing much .  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have other plans . 
 I don't like him . He's always rushing and never listens to me .  
 No , let's just sit here and relax .  
 I don't think it's a good idea . It can make people violent .  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it . I have a prior engagement . 
 I don't think so .  
 No , I don't .  
 They're not very good at it .  
 No , it's not true . We're just good friends . 
 I didn't want to tell you .  
 No , I haven't had time yet . 
 Not good . I have a headache .  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it tonight . I have a prior engagement .  
 Not good , I'm afraid . My boss is really on my case and I'm feeling very stressed out .  
 No .
 Hello , how are you ?  
 I don't want to go out. I'm too tired.  
 I don't think so .  
 That's a bit expensive .  
 I don't like it either . 
 Oh no , not again . She always complains about something .  
 I don't think it's necessary to have a business card . I don't think it's necessary to spend money on it .  
 No , it's just a new one .  
 No , I didn't . 
 I don't like watching movies . 
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know .

 It was terrible . I hated it .  
 Nothing .

 No , I don't like it .  
 What do you mean ?  
 There are four people in my family .  
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just staying here .

 No , I don't think so . I'm not interested in shopping .  
 I don't feel like going out , I'd rather stay home and relax .  
 No , I'm not .  
 Sorry , I didn't see you . 
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 That's not true . The stepmother was a good person .  
 No , you can't . The door is closed .  
 Nothing much , just feeling a bit down today .  
 I don't think so . I'm too tired .  
 I have nothing to do this sunday .  
 Hello.how are you ?

 He didn't say anything .  
 Oh , no . He's not the one I was expecting .  
 No , thank you . I'm not very thirsty .

 No , you may not .  
 I don't want to go . I'm tired .

 I'm sorry , I don't understand . Can you repeat that ?  
 I don't think I'm a good mother . I'm always too busy with work and other things .  
 That's a shame . You should try to speak up more in class .  
 He's a doctor . 
 I don't like them .

 But they also have some disadvantages , such as the radiation they emit and the addiction they cause .  
 Oh, really ? I didn't know that .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't find it very interesting .  
 I don't think so . It's not a good idea to punish people in such a cruel way . 
 I don't want another drink . I'm going home now .  
 I don't have any spare time .  
 Oh no ! Not another one !  
 I don't know .  
 That's crazy ! 
 I'm sorry , I can't make it .

 Oh, that's too bad .  
 No , I'm not kidding . He's not there at all . 
 Can I come with you ?  
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any record of a reservation under that name . 
 I don't think so . He's not popular enough .  
 That's so boring . I hate wearing formal clothes every day .  
 He didn't win .  
 I don't know .  
 No .
 No , I'm not .  
 I'm sorry , I can't come to the party tonight . I have a prior engagement .

 No . Who is he ?  
 No , I'm not in the mood . I'll stay here and watch TV .  
 No , I haven't .

 I don't think so .  
 No , I haven't . I had a terrible headache all day long .  
 I don't think so . It's too crowded and dirty .  
 Oh, that’s a bad idea . You can’t sing and play an instrument at the same time . 
 I don't know .  
 I can’t afford it . 
 I don't know .  
 I don't think so . The acting is terrible and the plot is boring .  
 It was terrible . I had to work all day and night and never had a chance to see the city .  
 I don't know . I just felt like coming in .  
 That's not possible . 
 I didn't want to tell you .  
 I didn't like it .  
 Don't go out !  
 Hello . How are you ?  
 I understand how you feel . But you should try to be more positive and look for a new job. 
 No , she didn't .  
 I don't know . Maybe I'll just stay at home and watch TV .  
 I don't know.  
 What a terrible thing ! 
 I didn't do anything .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not feeling well today .

 Oh, no ! Are you all right ?  
 I don't believe you . You always say that .  
 Oh, really ? I didn't know you wrote poetry. 
 Oh, no . It's not mine . It's my friend's .  
 Why ?  
 I've been feeling terrible . I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping .  
 No , I don't .  
 Sorry , I don't have my watch with me .  
 No , I didn't .  
 That's not true .  
 Oh , I'm sorry .

 You can call him Bob .  
 I don't think I can make it .  
 It's not worth it .  
 No , I walk . 
 I don't like picnics .  
 That's not true . They are just copying the dance moves from the music video .

 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , I can't make it this time .

 I don't want it .  
 Oh no !  
 B :: Nice to see you too , A .

 Nothing .  
 No way !  
 No , I haven't . I miss my home and my family .  
 I didn't take any courses in college.  
 No , I haven't .  
 No , I don't want to go . I prefer to stay at home and relax . 
 No , it's not . You can sit here .  
 That's not true . Eggplants are better than potatoes .  
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that . 
 I don't know .  
 I don't think so .  
 I don't believe it .  
 I don't want to come back to the classroom .
 No , I don't have any hobbies .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know what you're talking about .  
 It's raining outside .
