 No thanks , I don't smoke . 
 That's terrible news . What are we going to do now ?
 That's not good enough . We need to do better than that .
 Is that true ? I never knew that .
 I don't think I have any .
 It takes us about 4 hours by car to get to London .
 You failed. You didn't follow the traffic rules and drove too fast.  
 I'm feeling terrible . I had a nightmare last night .  
 I don't know . Why don't you ask the cook ?  
 I'm sorry , Kara is not available at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 No , I'm just looking for a place to stay for the night .  
 No , I'm not . Why ? 
 That's too bad . What happened ?  
 I'm sorry , I don't think you can help me . I'm looking for a book on the history of art , but I'm not sure if you have it .  
 Sorry , we don't have any maps of downtown area .  
 I'm sorry , we don't have any available rooms at the moment .  
 I'm sorry , but I haven't finished my meal yet .  
 I'm sorry , I don't think so . I'm just browsing .  
 I don't think that's a good idea . You should buy her something else instead .
 No , thank you . I'm just resting .  
 I didn't do anything .
 I'm afraid not . You'll have to go to the photo shop to have it done .
 I'm sorry but I don't think I'm the right person to ask about myself .
 You and me both , bro . I just can't resist the temptation of junk food .
 I'm not interested .
 I'm not good . I had a fight with my boyfriend last night .  
 I'm not interested in insurance .
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in buying anything . 
 I can't believe it!  
 I'm afraid I'm not good at writing .
 I don't think you can .
 I'm sorry , Mr . Cooper , Ms . Wang is not in the office at the moment . Could you please leave a message ?
 I'm sorry , I can't help you now . I have to go to the bank .  
 No , I haven't . But I'm willing to learn .
 Not much . Just the same old thing .  
 No , I always park legally .  
 I don't know . I just wanted to talk to someone .  
 I don't think so . I'm just looking for a friend .
 I didn't take it . You're the one who stole it . You're the one who should go to jail !
 I'm sorry , Professor Clark is not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 No , I didn't . Why do you ask ?
 Sorry , I'm busy . I have to go now .  
 I don't want anything . 
 I'm not Mr. Black , I'm Mr. Johnson .  
 Sorry , you'll have to ask someone else . I don't know .
 I don't know . Ask someone else .
 Oh , it's just a simple dish I'm preparing for dinner . Nothing special .  
 I don't want anything . 
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I have other plans .
 I don't think so . I can help myself .
 I'm afraid that won't be possible .
 No , I haven't .
 I'm sorry , I don't think so .
 I'm sorry , I have a lot of work to do myself .  
 I don't like seafood .
 I don't know .  
 I don't think so . It's just a common one .
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just staying at home .
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I don't want to get involved in this kind of thing .
 I don't think so .
 I don't think it's a good idea to start working on this now . We should wait until we have more information .
 I don't like salad . 
 I'm sorry , we don't have any fish .  
 I don't think you have a chance of getting the job . You're not qualified enough .
 I heard that the raise is only 5% .
 That's all right . What's the new date ?  
 I'm sorry , I'm just looking for information .  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I don't know . I just came in to get away from the noise outside .  
 I don't know . I just dialed the number by mistake .  
 Sorry , I don't have any chocolate .  
 No , you may not . Please leave the room immediately .  
 I don't think I can help you with that .
 I'm sorry . He's not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 No , she's not crying . She's just a little upset .  
 You can't afford one .  
 They're 2 dollars each . 
 I'm sorry , I'm in a hurry now .  
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in that .  
 I haven't seen it .
 I'm sorry , but I don't think I can lend it to you .
 I don't think I'll be able to make it . I have a lot of things to do today .
 I'm sorry . You're out of your mind .
 No , nothing's wrong . I'm just a bit tired .
 I'm not sure . I may stay for a week or two .  
 I'm full already .
 I'm sorry . I don't know . Can you tell me the way ?
 That's alright . You're not the only one who's late . 
 I'm sorry , I don't know . Can you tell me ?
 I'm sorry , I don't think I know you .  
 No , I don't .  
 I don't know . I don't have a car .
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I'm sorry , Dr.Cooper is out of the office until next Tuesday . Can I help you with anything else ?
 I'm just passing by .  
 No , it's not .
 I don't think I can help you with that .
 What's the matter ? Are you hurt ?
 I don't want to eat anything .  
 It's not here . You must be in the wrong place .
 I'm sorry , I'm not interested in buying anything . 
 I don't know . Ask someone else .
 No , I don't like seafood . 
 I'm sorry , Professor Clark is not in at the moment . Can I help you with anything else ?
 I’m not feeling well . I have a headache .
 It is not slow at all . It is just you who is feeling lazy today .
 What's the matter ? Are you sick or something ?  
 I'm not feeling well . I have a headache .
 I don't think that's a good idea . You'll get fat .
 I don't think it's a good idea . We have a lot of work to do .
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I'm sorry , but he's not in today .  
 I'm sorry , we don't have any pearls here .  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I'm not interested in talking about myself .
 I don't know . You'd better ask someone who is more experienced .
 That's not true . I've been here for years and I've never seen such a smooth traffic .
 It's not looking too bad from here either .
 I'm sorry , sir . We don't serve wine before the main course . 
 I don't want to go .
 No , she's not . Why do you ask ?
 I'm sorry , I'm not able to do that .
 No , I haven't . Could you show me ?  
 What's the problem ?  
 It's too small for all that stuff . You should get a bigger one .
 I am not going anywhere .  
 I'm afraid not . I have a lot of things to do tomorrow . 
 I don't think so . I haven't seen it .
 I'm sorry . I'm afraid I can't help you .  
 No , it's demand .
 I don't think I've seen him around here before .
 I don't want anything . I just came in to get out of the rain . 
 I'm sorry , I don't have any insurance background .
 I don't think so .
 No way! I don't have enough money .  
 I'm afraid not . I'm very busy at the moment .  
 I can't help you . I don't know how to use them either .
 No , I don't . 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you . I don't have any food with me .  
 I'm sorry , Mr . Brown . I don't think we can agree on the terms of the contract . We'll have to start the negotiations all over again .
 You don't need a black suit . You already have three of them .
 I'm not feeling well today . The flu has been going around the office .
 I don't think so .
 I don't think so . I still have some questions about the company .
 I don't think that's a good idea . You should probably stay home and rest .
 I'm not sure. I think I'm a bit of a worrier and I get stressed easily.  
 I don't think she is professional enough to handle the job .
 No , I wasn't .  
 I don't think it's a good idea to spend so much money on a company retreat . We should focus on saving money instead of spending it on unnecessary things .
 Are you sure you want to do that ? Yoga is not for everyone .
 I'm sorry , I'm not fluent in English .
 No , I don't want them washed . I'll wash them myself .  
 You're not sick , are you ? You just need to get more rest .  
 I'm not an early bird . I usually stay in bed until noon .
 I don't think you need any cosmetics. You look fine just the way you are.
 I'm not interested in giving you advice . You can figure it out yourself .
 I'm sorry , I'm not interested in buying a house .
 No , I haven't . Why do you ask ?
 I don't think so . I don't think I'm the one causing the problem .
 I don't think so .
 I'm afraid so . According to the school rules , smoking is strictly prohibited on the school premises .  
 I'm not interested .
 I don't think so . The service is already included in the bill .
 I'm afraid there isn't a train to Tibet from here .
 I'm not a taxi . What do you want ?
 I'm not checking in any luggage . I'll just bring my carry-on bag .
 I'd prefer to stay here for a while .
 You can't wear black to a wedding , it's not appropriate .
 I don't think you can do anything for me . I just came to see you because I have nothing else to do .
 I'm sorry , I'm in a hurry now . I'll catch you later .  
 I don't think so .  
 I'm afraid I'm not good at this subject .  
 No , I'm just browsing .  
 No way ! I'm not in the mood for it . 
 No , I can't tell .  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 It's not that impressive .
 What happened to you ?
 I'm sorry , but I have other plans for the weekend .
 What do you mean by that ? 
 That's too bad . What kind of car do you have ?
 I can't help you with that . I'm sorry . 
 I'm sorry , I don't think I know you .  
 I'm not interested .
 I don't know . Why don't you look at your watch ?  
 That's not interesting at all . 
 I'm sorry , but I'm afraid we don't accept credit cards . You'll have to pay in cash .
 I don't think I'll like it here . It's too noisy and the food is too spicy for me .
 I'm sorry , but the position has already been filled .  
 I'm just browsing , thanks .
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for something .  
 You’re not taking the assignment seriously , are you ?
 I don't think that's a good idea . You don't know what kind of person he is .
 No , thank you . I'm full .
 I'm sorry , it doesn't . You can take the No. 10 bus instead .  
 Not good . My fiancé just called off the wedding .  
 No , I haven't . 
 No way ! I'm not in the mood for coffee . I'd rather have a cup of tea .
 That's not true . We have a record of you ordering the movie .  
 I'm sorry , but I can't go . I have other plans . 
 I'm sorry , he's not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 I'm sorry , I don't have it with me .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't remember selling you a China dress this morning .  
 I heard that the raise is only 5% .
 I'm not interested in going shopping with you .
 I don't think I can sign this . It's too one-sided .
 No , it's not . You should go to the other side of the airport .  
 No , I wasn't . I had to work late at the office .  
 No , I haven't . I don't have a computer at home .  
 It takes an hour by bus and 30 minutes by car .
 I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to ask you the way to the nearest bus stop .  
 I don't know . I'm just browsing .  
 I don't think so . I don't want to be disturbed by your noise .
 That's not what we think .
 I don't think I can make it to the meeting today , Mr . Johnson . I have a lot of other things on my plate .
 No , I think I can find my way around .  
 No , I'm not .
 I can't help you with the ladder . I'm afraid of heights . 
 I don't think anyone will ever read it .
 I don't know why you didn't receive your check . You should contact the unemployment office to find out why .
 That's too bad . I was hoping to catch you later .
 No , I don't want anything . 
 I don't think it's suitable for us to do that .
 Terrible . I got a parking ticket and my boss yelled at me all day .  
 I'm sorry , I don't know . You'd better check the job posting or the company's website for the specific requirements .
 I don't know . I haven't done anything interesting .
 I'm sorry , but you don't have enough balance to withdraw any money .  
 I'm sorry , it's not allowed to take pictures in the museum .
 Sorry , there isn't any .  
 I'm sorry , Sir . I overslept .  
 I can't afford it .  
 No , that's all . 
 No , I don't .
 I'm not Mr Brown , I'm Mr Green .
 I don't have it with me .  
 I don't think you need to include your hobbies in your CV . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't think it's a good idea .  
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 No , I'm not hungry . I'll wait until I get home . 
 No , I don't .  
 Oh no , I forgot about it . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't know where it is . Could you ask someone else ?
 I'm sorry but I won't be able to meet your deadline .
 No , I'm afraid we don't have any cheaper ones .  
 I'm sorry , I don't think you can do anything for me .
 I'm afraid there's been a mistake . The room service menu is not available in this room .
 I'm sorry , I don't have any pets . But you can go to the pet store to see what they have .  
 What do you want ?  
 What's the matter ? Did something go wrong ?
 No , I haven't seen it .  
 I'm sorry , I didn't mean to do that .  
 I'm sorry , I can't . I don't have access to the internet at the moment .  
 I don't think I can make it today . I'm feeling really tired .
 I'm sorry , he's not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 I'm not sure . I just don't feel well .  
 I've been feeling quite down lately . I've been having trouble sleeping at night .
 I'm sorry , but it's not ready yet .  
 No , what happened ?  
 I'm not reading the newspaper . I'm just pretending to be interested in it .
 That's too expensive . I can't afford it .
 No , I don't need any help . I'm just passing by . 
 No , I'm not . I'm still working on it . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 I haven't been feeling well lately .  
 No , it's not . 
 It's especially cold when the wind is blowing .
 I'm not sure if I can help you with that . I'm not very good at job interviews myself .
 No , thank you . I'm okay .  
 I don't think so . I don't think I can handle all the stress and pressure of moving to a new place .
 That's too bad . What are you looking for in a new place ?
 I'm sorry , I'm just looking for a good book to read .  
 I don't think you should do that .  
 I don't need anything .  
 I'm sorry but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to know if you have any openings for a job .

 Oh , he's in a terrible mood again . He's been like that since he woke up .  
 I'm not interested in talking about myself .
 I don't think so . It's too expensive for me .
 Sorry , we don't serve smoothies . Could we have two glasses of orange juice instead ?
 I don't think it's a good idea to count on our fingers like that .
 I'm sorry , but the position has already been filled . 
 I'm sorry , there isn't one nearby .  
 Oh no! What a shame!  
 No way !  Let's leave it up until the New Year .  
 I'm not interested in anything . I just came to see the place .  
 I'm not interested .
 No , I don't .  
 We don't have a connecting flight . We're going to stay here for a week .
 I don't think that's a good idea . You should consider other options .
 I don't think so . The weather is terrible outside .
 I'm sorry , we don't have any available table now .  
 I don't think so . It's the only way to get there .
 I don't think I can make it . I have a lot of things to do .
 Oh no , that's too bad . I'll have to get used to seeing you in the evenings .
 No . I don't think so .  
 I am not a mechanic . You should take it to a garage .
 I haven't thought about it yet .  
 I don't think so .
 I'm sorry , Mr.White is not available at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 I'm sorry , I don't have my passport with me .
 I don't think so . I'm just browsing the internet .

The stockholders are the owners of the company and have the right to vote on important matters such as the election of directors and the approval of major corporate actions .
 I don't think that's any of your business .
 No way ! You have to finish it now .  
 She’s in the staff room .  
 I'm feeling a bit down today .  
 you there .  
 Not at all . Go ahead .
 No , I don't think so . I don't trust any of the candidates .
 I don't think that's a good idea . Let's just forget it .
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm just browsing . Thanks .
 It's not that big .
 No , I can't stand the smell of food .  
 I don't think we have that in our store .  
 Oh , come on ! It will be so cute and fun to have a pet !
 I don't think I'll be using it .
 Oh , that sounds great . I've been wanting to get away for a while . But I haven't decided on any specific place yet .
 I haven't declared my income and I don't want to pay tax .
 Oh , nothing much . Just feeling a little fed up with things in general .  
 I'm sorry , I haven't seen it .  
 I don't think anyone can be considered the greatest .
 I don't like playing games .
 Sorry , I can't give you any more information on that . It's all confidential .
 Who is calling me ?
 I don't think I can do that . I have a lot of things to do myself .
 I'm not interested .
 No , it's not . It's a regular shop .  
 I'm sorry , I don't think so . I'm just looking for a book on the history of art .  
 No way ! Dalian is much colder than New York !
 I'm sorry , I don't have anything to show you . 
 I don't think so . I don't want to go to China .
 I'm afraid I'm not the right person to ask. I don't know anything about job-hunting on the web. 
 I'm sorry , I don't know where it is .  
 Sorry , we don't have any cleansing milk in stock .  
 No , she's not here . Can I take a message ?  
 You can put them in the overhead compartment . 
 I don't think it's fair that only people who live in big cities can afford to shop there .
 No , thank you . I'm just browsing .  
 I don't like seafood . 
 I haven't got my passport with me .
 I'm sorry , I don't like talking about myself .
 I think it's outdated and not very efficient .
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in booking a flight right now .  
 I'm sorry , but I haven't received any test results from the other day .  
 I'm afraid not . I'm not confident in my English .
 I haven't been feeling well lately . I've been having a lot of stomach problems .
 I don't want your card .
 I'm sorry , I'm not good at planning parties .  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think you're the right person for the job . 
 No , you should check in at the counter over there .  
 I don't think any of them are good . They all have side effects .
 That's a lot of hair to lose . Are you sure you want to do it ?
 I'm sorry , I can't do that . I don't have any tea left .
 No way ! I don't want to go there .
 I'm sorry but I don't have any work achievements to talk about .
 I don't think so .
 I'm sorry . I don't know .  
 I'm feeling down today .  
 I don't know . I just use my phone for calling and texting .  
 I'm sorry , I have a lot of work to do tomorrow .  
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any vacancies at the moment .  
 That's too bad . Are you looking for a new place to live ?  
 I'm sorry , but I don't think that's a good idea .  
 Sorry , I don't lend out my magazines . I'm very possessive about them .
 No , I don't .
 B :: I'm not Wily . I'm his twin brother .
 I'm afraid not . We don't have any taxis available at that time .  
 I'm sorry sir , but I'm afraid I can't help you . You'll have to leave the store now .  
 I don't know . I'm just passing the time .  
 I'm sorry sir . You can't come in . We don't allow visitors today .  
 What is it ? I don't want to hear it .  
 No , thank you . I'm full . Positive Response:  Yes , please . I would love some .
 That's not true . It's more expensive because you have to pay for everything you take .
 No , I didn't . What's the plan ?  
 I'm afraid that our company is not an exception . It's hard to predict what will happen .
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in buying any animals .
 I don't think so .
 No , I didn't . The food was terrible .  
 I haven't seen it . What are the seven wonders ?
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any available rooms at the moment .  
 I'm sorry , we don't serve pizza here .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in opening a new account at the moment .  
 We're a small company , but we do our best to provide top-quality service .
 That's way too expensive . I can't afford that . 
 I don't like either of them . 
 I'm sorry , but I don't have the authority to approve credit card applications . You should apply at a bank or a financial institution .  
 Not really. I just have a fast metabolism. 
 That's all right . I'm sure we'll meet again .  
 No , I just wanted to see the Manager .  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 That's too bad . Can't you get it fixed ?  
 I don't think so . It's too violent and bloody .
 I don't know .
 I'm sorry , I'm not able to do that . I have a lot of work to do myself .
 I'm sorry , I'm already working for another company .
 I don't think we can make it to the top . The altitude is too high and we don't have enough oxygen .
 I was busy with some work . 
 I'm not good . I've been feeling very depressed lately .  
 I'm sorry , but we don't accept returns on clothing items .  
 I don't like any of them .
 I don't think you can help me .
 What's the matter ?  
 I didn't leave any medicine here .
 I don't think it's a good idea to rent a house . It's too expensive .
 I'm sorry to hear that . What are you going to do about it ?  
 I'm sorry , but it's not on display .  
 I'm not sure . I've never had to do that before . Positive Response:  Sure . Have you considered checking online listings or asking friends for recommendations ?
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .  
 I don't think so . It's just another overpriced gadget .
 I don't think I would like to have any permanent .  
 I don't think you can get more amenities . You have to make do with what you have .
 No , you have to go down the road and turn left .  
 I'm sorry , we don't serve breakfast .  
 I'm not good . I've been feeling very depressed lately .  
 No , I think I'll just have a hamburger .  
 I don't know . Ask the staff at the counter .
 I'm not tired yet .
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for something . 번역결과  
 I'm sorry but I don't think it's a good idea .
 That's strange . I've never heard of a hotel without a fourth floor .
 I don't think I want to go anywhere . I'm quite happy to stay at home .
 I’m sorry but I’m not interested in selling anything .
 I don't think so .  
 I’m sorry , but we don’t offer personal loans .  
 What do you mean by that ?
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to ask you about the weather . 
 I'm sorry . I don't think I know you .
 It's not really my style. 
 I don't know . Why don't you ask him ?
 No way! It's not his fault. 
 That's not true . They can sell their products as they are .
 I know what you mean . It's such a bore .
 Sorry , we're closed today .  
 No , I'd rather walk .
 No , I'm not . I'm just a poor boy , sir .  
 I don't like it because it's not my style .
 No thanks , I just ate . 
 I don't think it's a good idea to go there . They have terrible service and the food is overpriced .
 No , I'm just passing through .  
 It went poorly . I found several major issues that need to be addressed immediately .  
 We don't celebrate it .
 That's too bad . What happened ?
 I don't know . I'm just feeling down today .  
 No , I prefer carrying them myself .  
 It's a long way to go .  
 No , thank you . We don't want any . 
 I don't know . We can't just sit here and do nothing . 
 I'm sorry but I can't go along with that.  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I don't think I can afford it .
 I'm feeling a bit under the weather .  
 Sorry , I can't . I don't have any change on me .
 That's not possible . The flight has already left .
 I didn't graduate from any university .
 I don't think he's really hurt . He's probably just trying to get out of work .
 No , I haven't . I don't have a computer .  
 I've been better . I just broke up with my boyfriend .
 I'm not interested in sports .  
 That's great ! But you should be careful on the road .  
 Thank you , but I'm afraid it's not mine . I'm just renting it .
 I'm sorry , I don't think I know you .  
 No , we don't . 
 Don't be nervous . Just relax and enjoy the moment . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just wandering around aimlessly .
 Sorry , we're all booked up .
 I don't think it's necessary to teach them that way .
 I'm afraid so . The seat is already taken by someone else .
 You should have thought of that before you started drinking .  
 I don't know .
 You should have received it on Friday . If you haven't received it by now , you may want to contact the unemployment office to inquire about the reason .
 No , I'm not . I'm from Ireland .
 I don't think so . I don't believe in buying things just for the sake of a special occasion . 
 I'm sorry , but the person you are trying to reach is not available at the moment .  
 I don't know . I just woke up and found myself here . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 I don't know . They haven't asked me yet .
 I know . It's all because of John . He never thinks of others . 對於這個例子，請問這是什麼樣的情境呢？
 I don't know . I'm just feeling down today .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to ask if you knew where I could find a good restaurant around here . 
 Sorry , I don't know . I'm not from around here .  
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to ask you a question .
 I'm sorry , I don't know .  
 I'm afraid it's closed on Mondays .
 I'm sorry , we don't have any available at the moment .  
 I'm sorry , I can't sing .  
 I'm not interested in helping you with that. 
 No , I'm just browsing .  
 Oh , I don't think so .
 I'm afraid the boat has already left .  
 No , I'm lost . Can you help me find my way ?  
 Is that all ? I thought there would be more .
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 No , I haven't . Could you help me ?  
 I am sorry but we have already employed a copywriter .
 I don't want to go to the hairdresser's .  
 I don't think so .
 No , we're not ready yet . Could you give us a few more minutes ?
 No , I don't like cooking . 
 I don't think it's a good idea to raise the prices again . People are already struggling to afford them .
 I don't like either of them . 
 That's great news , but I'm not surprised. Your product is always top-notch . 
 I'm sorry , I can't help you with that . 
 I don't think so . It's not really my style .
 It's too big for me to explore .
 I don't think that's a good idea . You'll regret it if you buy something you can't afford .
 I don't like it at all . It's so small and cramped .
 No , I didn't complete it . I dropped out after the first year .
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .
 I'm not in the mood for any trouble .  
 You're not the only one . It's hard to find your way around here . But don't worry , you'll get the hang of it soon enough .  
 I'm sorry , we don't have any available at the moment . Can I put you on the waiting list ?
 No , I don't think so . I don't trust any of them .  
 I'm not interested .
 I don't think I work effectively with anyone .
 No , I didn't . What's the one from the Dalai Lama ?  
 It's alright . We are used to waiting for you .
 No , I'm not hungry . 
 No , I haven't . What kind of tactics are they trying to use ?
 I'm sorry sir , but I don't think you're in a position to help me . You see , I'm the one who's in control here .  
 That's correct . There are no flights available .  
 I don't think they could be ended . They are too strong .
 I’m sorry , but I’m not authorized to give out those files . 
 I don't know . I'm not interested in any job .
 That's what they're paid for .
 I'm sorry , but I'm not Miss Wu . I'm just an ordinary teacher .  
 I'm not typing anything . I'm just pretending to type .
 I'm sorry , it's not for sale .  
 I don't think so . He's always late for everything .
 I'm not feeling well . I think I'm coming down with something . 
 I'm afraid that won't be possible . We close at 6 .  
 Oh no , what's wrong with it ?
 That's too bad . What class is it ?
 No , nothing's wrong . I was just thinking about something .
 I don't think so . It's too noisy and crowded .
 It was all right , I suppose . But I don't think I'll be ordering the same thing again .
 No way ! I don't have the money to travel .
 It's not mine . I just work here .
 I don't want anything . 
 No , thank you . I'm just calling to make a reservation for a flight to Paris next week .  
 I'm not back yet . I'm still in the office .
 I'm afraid there aren't any available .  
 I didn't choose your company . I was forced to work here .
 Oh , I didn't ask for an extra blanket .  
 I'm sorry , but he's not in at the moment . Can I take a message ?
 I'm sorry . I don't know . You'd better ask someone else .
 I'm sorry , but it's not our policy to exchange or refund food items .  
 I don't care . I'll do it tomorrow .
 I'm not feeling well today . I think I'm coming down with something . 
 Oh, she's dead. 
 I'm not Jim , I'm Tom . I'm looking for a glass of water .
 I don't think I can help you with that .
 I'm sorry . I don't know the answer to that question .
 I don't think you can do anything for me . I just came to see you because I have nothing else to do .
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 I'm sorry but the show is cancelled . We don't have any tickets left .  
 That's not true . It's more important to be honest and sincere .
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any more toner cartridges in stock .  
 I'm afraid we don't have any in stock .  
 No , I'm okay . Thanks .
 I don't think it's a good idea . I think you should focus on your studies first .
 I don't know .
 No . We just came to have a look .  
 I'm sorry but I'm afraid I can't give you any information on that . You'll have to call back later .
 That's a bit steep for us , I'm afraid .
 I'm sorry . I don't think I know you .
 Not really . They're always finding ways to get around it .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm sorry , but the room is already made up .  
 The company is facing a lot of financial pressures and the market competition is very intense .
 I'm sorry to hear that . What kind of bad habits does he have ?
 I don't know . I'm just so unhappy .  
 No , I didn't . I was busy with some other things .  
 I'm sorry , I can't do that .
 I'm not holding you in a jail cell . You're just imagining things .
 I'm sorry , I can't . I have to work .
 I don't think that's a good idea . It's not safe to go inside a stranger's house .
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any new cars in stock . We only have a few used ones left .  
 No , I don't think so . I have to finish my homework .  
 That's too bad . You should have let me know earlier .  
 No , just looking .  
 I'm not Ms Anderson .
 I don't think it's a good idea to buy it . It's too expensive and not worth the money .
 No , I didn't pack it myself . It has been out of my possession at several times before checking-in . 
 I'm sorry.He's not here at the moment.Can I take a message ?  
 No way . I'm not going to pay for something I'll never use .
 I'm sorry , Mr . Macmillan . I haven't seen it .  
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just staying at home .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not in the mood for jokes this morning .
 I'm sorry , I don't think so .
 That's not a good idea . You should save your money for the future .
 I'm not feeling well . I have a headache and my stomach hurts .  
 I don't think we can do it without the support of the head office .
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything .  
 No , I didn't know that .  
 I don't feel like reading right now .
 No , I haven't .  
 I didn't find it . I hate looking for apartments .  
 No , what happened ?  
 I wouldn't do such a thing in a million years .
 You're always talking about your diet . Why don't you just enjoy life?
 Oh , I see . Welcome to our company .  
 No , I don't . But I have a good sense of humor .  
 I don't think it's necessary to call anyone . We can just open the windows and let the fresh air in .
 No , I don't .  
 No way! I don't like horror movies .
 It's not that hot , don't exaggerate .
 I'm not hungry , thank you . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . I'll look into it and get back to you as soon as possible .
 It's going to rain all day .  
 I'm not sure yet . I haven't received the acceptance letter .
 I don't know . I'm not interested in sports .
 I don't know . Why don't you look it up in the encyclopedia ?  
 They're not bad , but I prefer my old ones .
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened ?
 That's too bad . What were you waiting for ?
 I don't think that's a good idea . It's better to forget the past and move on .
 That's a pity . I like rainy days .
 I don't think I'll be able to go on the trip with you guys .
 I don't think so . She is always complaining about her health and never wants to do anything .
 I don't believe in that kind of thing .
 No , thank you . I'm just looking for something .  
 What do you want ?  
 I am sorry but I am not in the mood to help anyone today .  
 No , it's not . This is the XYZ company .  
 I'm not sure . You'd better check the owner's manual .
 I'm sorry , I don't think I can make it to the party tonight . I have a lot of work to do .
 I don't think so . I'm not sure if I can handle it .
 What ? You got a job ? When did you start working ?  
 No , he has never missed one of our parties .  
 It's not so beautiful . It's just a plain and boring view .
 Oh no , you're not the Easter bunny ?
 I am sorry that I couldn't make it .  
 ... I don't know what's going to happen .  
 I'm not sure. I have a lot of things to do before I can go.  
 I don't think so . I'm not ready to leave yet .
 What's the matter with it ?
 I'm sorry , but I'm not married .
 No way ! You'll flunk for sure .  
 No , it's not . It's just some pop music .
 I'm not his friend . He's just an acquaintance .
 No , I'm from California .
 I haven't read any good book recently .
 I'm not kidding . I don't know where he is .
 I don't think so . He's always been a bit of a slacker .
 No , I haven't .  
 I'm feeling a bit down today .  
 I don't think so . It's a beautiful day outside . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
 I'm sorry to bother you , but I'm looking for a job .  
 I don't know. 
 I don't know , I just feel like everything is going wrong .
 No , I never did .  
 I'm sorry , I have a lot of things to do tomorrow .  
 I'm afraid I must be going now . I have no idea it was so late .
 I'm sorry , I don't have time for you right now .  
 I don't think I can go on with this any longer .
 No , I haven't . I haven't been to the cinema for a long time .  
 Is she really ? I don't think so .
 I'm not going anywhere . I'm just staying at home .  
 I don't remember . We might have been discussing the weather .
 I don't know . 
 I don't know . I'm just feeling down today .  
 I'm not doing well. I've been feeling depressed lately.  
 He's a real hard-ass .  
 You'll get there eventually. Keep practicing.
 What does that mean ?
 I'm sorry , I don't know much about it . 
 That's not true . My family is not here .
 I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier . I had some things to take care of .
 I'm sorry , I can't help you now . I have to finish my homework first .
 I don't know . It's up to the teacher to decide .
 That's a big change . Are you sure you want to do that ?
 No , I'm okay . Thanks for asking .
 I don't think so . It's too windy and rainy for sailing .
 It was a disaster. My husband and I had a huge argument right before the ceremony, and we barely made it through the vows without breaking down in tears.
 No way! I don't like horror movies .
 I ’ m not sure about my final destination . I just want to travel around and explore the country .
 I'm sorry , but I'm not interested in buying anything . I just wanted to ask you for some information . 
 No , I don't . I think it's a waste of time .  
 I'm not interested in talking to you .
 Who did you see ?
 I don't think it's a good idea .
 I’m sorry to hear that . I’m not feeling very well today .
 It was terrible . The music was too loud and the food was cold .  
 Oh , I'm so depressed . I just broke up with my boyfriend .
 I don't think so . They fell in love with each other and got married for love .
 No , it's not Cathy . Who's calling , please ?  
 I haven't been able to do much outside .
 No , she's not coming today .  
 Oh , nothing much . Just the usual routine .  
 I'm not good . I've been feeling sick for days .  
 No problem . I'm sorry that I couldn't offer you more . 
 That's quite all right . It's nothing much .  
 Not much . Just the same old thing .  
 I'm sorry , I have other plans .
 I don't think he's a very good doctor . He doesn't seem to know what he's doing .
 No way ! He's so boring . Let's go out and have some fun ourselves .
 I think it's disgusting and it shouldn't be shown to the public. 
 I'm afraid not . I have a lot of work to do . 
 I don't think it's a good idea . It will make our employees more lazy .
 No , I don't .  
 They are not good at all . They are always fighting and making a mess .  
 No way! We're just good friends. 
 I didn't think it was important for you to know .
 I haven't had the chance to look at it yet .  
 It's not going well at all . I'm really struggling with this new project .  
 I'm sorry , I have other plans .
 I'm not Helen . I'm her sister , Susan .
 No , I can't .
 Afternoon . How are you ?  
 That's too bad . You should have taken a day off to rest . 
 Oh , that's too bad . What's the matter ?
 You don't have to do that . It's perfectly fine the way it is .  
 I think it's great . It's the only music that really moves me .
 I don't know . Maybe she's just having a bad day .
 I don't think it's a good idea to use a business card as a bookmark .
 No , I just ironed it .  
 No , I didn't .
 I'm not interested in watching the Oscars . 
 We don't hire any cleaning ladies . We do all the cleaning ourselves .
 We don't have national day in our country .
 No way ! I'm going to stay here and enjoy myself .  
 It was terrible . The band was out of tune and the singer was off-key .  
 I don't know . I just feel so sad and depressed .  
 No way ! Joan is not that smart .
 That's great news , but I hope you won't get too overconfident and neglect your studies .  
 I don't like spicy food .  
 What do you mean by that ?  
 I don't know . I haven't seen them for years .
 I'm not Tom , I'm his twin brother .
 No , I didn't . I was busy with some other things .  
 That's too bad . 
 No , I haven't . 
 I don't think that's the right thing to do .
 I don't think I'm good at writing .  
 Why don't you like going outside ?
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened ?
 Is that so ? Chinese literature is quite boring .
 I don't think so . Linda is not interested in him at all .
 I don't think so .
 I don't think it's a good idea . I have to go back to my own country .
 Oh no! I don't want to go through that again! 
 That's a shame . I love playing computer games .
 I'm afraid not . I have a lot of work to do .  
 I'm sorry , I'm not good at making friends .
 No , I don't think so . I'm not really interested in shopping .
 I don't think that's a good idea . You've had too much already .
 No , I'm not .
 I'm watching where I'm going .  
 I don't know . Why don't you check it out ?  
 That's not true . She was a kind and loving person .
 I'm afraid not . The class has already started . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 I'm sorry , I don't think I can make it to the party tonight . I'm feeling a bit under the weather . |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
 I don't think that's a good idea . You have an early class tomorrow .
 I'm afraid I can't go out this Sunday . I have to work .
 I'm sorry . Susan is not available at the moment .  
 It's a meaningless existence .  
 What for ?  
 No , I didn't . Who won ? 
 I don't think so . I'm happy to stay outside and enjoy the weather .
 Sorry , I'm not allowed to give out information about the school . You should ask the school office .
 No thanks , I think I'll stick to water .
 I don't think so . It's just a waste of time and money . 
 I'm not feeling well today .  
 I don't think so . People are generally good at heart .
 I'm afraid I'm not that good at English .
 I'm sorry , I don't think I know you .  
 No , I'm not .
 No , not yet . I'm still looking around .  
 I don't drink alcohol .
 Oh , I'm sorry to hear that . What happened to him ?
 I know what you mean . Sometimes I feel the same way .
 I prefer eggplants to potatoes .
 That's not true . They look shorter that way .
 I don't think so . I'm not very hungry . 
 I don't know . I haven't decided yet .  
 I’m sorry , I don’t think I can do that . I have a lot of work to do .
 I haven't been in England .
 I don't think so .
 Is that so ? I didn't know that .
 I don't know .  
 I don't think he's wearing a white hat .
 No , I don't think so . I have to get back to the office and finish some work .
 I don't know who he is .
 That's all right . I'll lend you another one .
 I don't think so .  
 I don't think it's a good idea to go there . It's too far and we don't have enough time .
 No , I'm not . I'm too tired . 
 No , I don't think so .  
 It was a complete washout . We spent most of the time huddled under an umbrella .
 Oh no . Why is she getting a divorce ?
 I don't think I can handle it .
 I don't think so . Computers are just machines and they don't have the ability to teach anyone anything .
 I'm afraid not . I have a meeting scheduled for that day .
 I'm just trying to study for my exam .  
 I don't really care about the Winter Olympic Games .
 I haven't made any plans yet .  
 No , thank you . I don't drink alcohol .  
 That's quite all right . It's not your fault .
 I haven't thought about it .  
 No , I'm not . Why do you say so ?
 I'm not busy at all . I just don't have anything to do .
 I'm not from here . I come from a faraway place .
 I don't know . I try my best but sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough .
 That's because you're too shy to speak up . You need to work on your confidence if you want to be heard .
 He's not a doctor . He's a teacher .
 I don't think so . It's too hot to go out .
 No , not yet .  
 I'd love to ! But I don't have enough money .
 I don't think so . I have to go home and study for my exam .
 I’m fine . How about you ?
 No , I haven't .  
 I've got a terrible headache .  
 No way ! I'm into rap now .  
 That's true . They had to work very hard to make ends meet .
 No , I don't . Why ? Do you have something in mind ?  
 No , I don't .  
 That's not upsetting at all . He probably needed a break .
 No , I haven't .  
 What's the matter ? Is it dirty or something ?
 No , I don't .
 I don't think so . I'm not in the mood for going out .
 Oh no , you're not going to go to the game by yourself are you ?
 I don't think so . I have a lot of homework to do .
 But sometimes it also causes some problems . For example , it may lead to addiction and affect people's health and social relationships .
 Are you serious ? You're only 21 years old .
 You're welcome . I hope you enjoyed reading it .
 I don't think that's a fair punishment .
 No way . I'm driving tonight .
 I don't have any spare time . I have to work all the time to make ends meet .
 Oh no, what happened? Are you sure it's a good idea? 
 I don't know . She just doesn't seem herself lately .
 That's hard to believe . 
 I'm sorry , I have other plans .  
 I'm sorry , I have other plans . 
 That's too bad . You should have bought them from a better store .
 No way! I thrive on pressure and love being busy. 
 That's a shame . You should make time for yourself sometimes .
 That's not a good idea . You don't know what you're eating .
 I'm feeling fine . I'll be at work as usual .
 That's too bad . Why can't you go ?
 No , I don't like it at all . It's too stressful and tiring .  
 No , I haven't .  
 I don't think so . I find it quite refreshing to read a book in this weather .
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened ?
 I'm not kidding . I don't know where he is .
 No , don't go . Stay here and talk to me a little longer .
 I'm sorry , but we don't have any mid-size vehicles available .  
 I don't think so . He has no chance of winning .
 That's not fair . Why do they have to wear formal clothes every day ? 
 He was too nervous and made too many mistakes .  
 I don't know . Maybe it's because people are tired of the real world and want to escape into a fantasy world where everything is funny .
 No , I'm not . History is so boring .  
 Thank you , but I'm feeling terrible .  
 I'm not restless . I'm just a little bit tired .
 It's spelt with an "i".
 That's not surprising . He's been training for years .
 No , I didn't know that . I'm not interested in parties . 
 Oh no ! What happened ?  
 I don't know how to play chess .
 I have been here for three months now .
 I'm sorry , I can't remember the title .
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in playing with you .
 I don't know what you're talking about . I'm always like this .
 What's the matter with you ? Why are you so scared ?
 I don't know . Why don't you try that new restaurant across the street ?  
 No , I haven't . But I would love to go there someday .  
 I'm sorry , I don't think I know you .
 No , I'm not . I'm not in the mood to go out . 
 No . 
 No , I'm busy . I have to finish my homework .
 No , I haven't .  
 I don't know .
 Oh no , what happened ?  
 I don't think so . Smoking is really bad for your health .
 I don't believe that . Dolphins are not as smart as humans .
 That's too bad . You should try to eat less and exercise more .  
 I'm sorry , I can't go to the cinema with you tonight . I have other plans .
 I don't think it's right to use animals for our own purposes like that .
 She's not in today .
