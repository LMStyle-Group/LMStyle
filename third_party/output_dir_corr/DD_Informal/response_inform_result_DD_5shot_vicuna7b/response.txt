 What's up with you ?  
 Yeah , it's raining cats and dogs outside .  
 Hi , what's up ?  
 Oh , come on ! Don’t be so paranoid !  
 Oh, nothing much . I just got a bad news from my boss.  
 Did you get punished in school ?

 Can you help me with this problem ?  
 I'm good , thanks . How about you ?  
 He's a bit of a weirdo , isn't he ?  
 Don't worry , you'll get there in the end . It's not easy at first , but it's worth it .  
 Maybe he thinks it's big and ugly . 
 Sure , go ahead . What would you like to know ?
 Yeah , they all came to visit us .  
 Hi ! I'm happy you could make it .

 Not much , just been working hard .  
 Sure , I'll be there .  
 He's a bit of a wally .  
 Yeah , let's ask him .  
 I think it's a load of rubbish . It doesn't do any good and it's just a way of making money. 
 Yeah , why not ?  
 Yeah , that would be great .  
 Yeah , I know . I'm just not very good at it .  
 Are they winning any games ?
