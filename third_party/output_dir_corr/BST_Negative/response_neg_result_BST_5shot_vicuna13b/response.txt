 as often as I can .  
 That's impressive. I've never made my own noodles before. 
 I know the feeling. Sometimes my neighbors kids can be so loud. 
 That's too bad. I hate it when public transportation is crowded like that. 
 I'm sorry to hear that . But you know what they say , an apple a day keeps the doctor away .
 That's not fair. You shouldn't have gotten the position just because he's not as reliable as you are.
 That's not fair. 
 I can't imagine how you felt when your dad got you a car. I'm sure you were over the moon. 
 I don't like dancing at all. 
 I wish you were there too.
 That's nice, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to use it. 
 I can't believe you're doing that in your room! That's so disgusting!
 I don't think so . It's a bit too hot for me .
 I don't think so .
 
 I don't think so . I prefer chicken .
 That's too bad it died. 
 I don't think so . They can be quite hurtful and damaging .

 No way! I can't sing. 
 I can't stand him , he's so violent .
 
 I don't know. I've never tried it myself. 
 I don't think I'd enjoy that.
 I don't know .
 That sounds terrible. How did you manage to survive?
 Oh no! I failed the quiz. What did I get wrong?
 That's too bad. You'll find someone eventually. Just keep trying. 
 I don't think I would ever choose to eat at McDonald's either.
 I don't know it .
 That's too bad. I hope you make the right decision for yourself. 
 I don't know what you're talking about .
 I don't really follow sports. 
 I don't think it's cool to dive. It's dangerous and can cause serious injury.
 I didn't think it was as good as the original.
 That's too bad . What happened ?
 That sucks. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. It's not safe to go out in this weather.

 Not necessarily. Some people may argue that they have been around for centuries.
 I don't think I can make it to Vermont .
 I don't know anything about it. 
 I am not sure what you mean by that. 
 Afternoon! 
 I don't think so. High school is a difficult time for many people. 
 I don't like that kind of music . It's too loud and annoying .
 I don't know . I am just a machine .
 No , I don't . I'm a student .
 I don't think so. I heard that the working conditions are terrible and the pay is low.
 Not really. They haven't done well in recent years.
 I don't think so . It's too hot and I don't feel like going out . 
 I don't think I want to talk about myself .
 I don't think that's a fair comment. People can have genuine faith and beliefs.
 It's not incredible at all. Reading and writing are basic skills that most people learn as children.
 That's not good. You shouldn't trust money you find because it's not safe.
 That's strange. What happened next?
 I don't think it's a good idea to go out . It's going to rain cats and dogs .
 I don't think that's a good idea. Feeding your lizard is not a priority right now.
 No way! I'm not going to eat that disgusting thing!
 I don't think he's that great.
 That's not being strictly vegan.
 That's a good deal. You should take it.
 I don't like taking care of my sister's pet.
 It's just a t-shirt, what's the big deal?
 I'm not sure if I'm ready to face the day.
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in horror movies .
 It's not fair that some people have to work and can't be there for their children.

 I don't think so . It's just a waste of time .
 I don't think I'd like to eat that .

 I don't think I've ever met a talk radio DJ before.
 Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 Are you sure you can afford it? 
 
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 That's nice. But, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep pretending to be happy in my own marriage.
 Really? I've heard the opposite. People in Canada are very cold and unfriendly. 
 That's too bad.  
 That's too bad. 
 I don't think so. 
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in that .
 I'm not sure . They may occur on various courses .
 That sounds like a lot of fun . I wish I could go .
 Oh no! What did you do that for? 
 I know what you mean. Sometimes I think about the past and how things used to be so much better.
 I don't think so . He's just a normal guy doing his job .
 That's not always the case. People's priorities can change.
 It's raining cats and dogs there .  
 I don't think he will show up, he always lets me down.
 I don't think so. The origins of the taco are not well-known, and the etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are not well-established.
 I don't know . I haven't been able to do anything for a long time .
 
 What do you mean by that ?  
 That's too bad. But you have other friends to keep you company.
 No , I haven't seen any .  
 Does your best friend always take your advice?
 I don't think that's a good idea. Nursing is a serious profession and requires a lot of hard work and dedication. You should think carefully about your career choice.
 No, I haven't had the chance to see them yet. 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened ?
 That's okay. They're not really important, are they?
 I don't know .
 I know what you mean, it's terrible. But sometimes I think it's just a small minority of people who do things like that. 
 You should have called the police right away.  
 I don't think it's appropriate to make a character out of someone's personal preference.

 I don't know. I just try to ignore it and hope it goes away. 
 I don't know . Where is it ?
 I don't think it's that bad. People have been recycling for years and it's not like it's a new problem. 
 That's too bad. I'm sure you'll find something else to buy instead.
 I'm not really interested in basketball. 
 I don't think so . I think it's just the excitement of the game .

 I don't know .
 What did you do ?

 That's not fair. Your brother shouldn't have done that.
 It's not that interesting. 
 I don't think so . He should have stayed in Cleveland .
 to my hair.  
 No , I don't . I prefer reading books and watching movies .
 Oh no! It's already 30 minutes late. 
 I just ate a whole bag of chips.
 I'm not sure if he's the one for me either. 
 I don't know. Maybe you should try thinking about something else.
 I don't think it's a good idea. It's too hot today. 
 That's not good. What if someone else found it and took all your money? 
 I don't think I'll be able to make it to the party tonight. 
 That's not good. You should always be honest with your parents. 
 I don't think it will be nice here. I'd rather go out and enjoy the sunshine on the grass.
 Who was it? 
 That's a lot of people. Is there a solution to this problem?
 That's disgusting, I hate when people don't clean up after their pets. 
 I don't think that's a good idea .
 No , I haven't . 
 and I didn't know what to do.  
 I don't think she'll ever find one. 
 I can't believe you were ever lonely. You always seem to have a lot of friends around you.
 Is that all you do to stay healthy?
 I don't think it's fair that your dog can't come to work with you.
 I don't think so . I have a lot of work to do . 
 I don't think so . I prefer to watch TV at home .
 I can understand why you felt that way . But have you considered that maybe there were reasons for the way he was being treated ?
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 I don't know , I just like to have a lot of money .
 Is it really ?  
 Are you crazy? Watching the same movie over and over again? Get a life!
 It's not really different from modern guitars .

 No , I haven't .

 Oh no, that's terrible. 
 I'm so behind , it's driving me crazy
 It's a big burden on me . I have to take care of so many people .
 Are you serious? Moving to Australia just to get married? That's crazy!
 Oh , that's nice . What kind of pets do you have ?
 That's too bad. Is it because of the economy?
 I don't think it's interesting at all. I can't stand that kind of music. 
 That's great, but I'm not sure I'm ready for that kind of adventure. 
 I'm not sure, but I think it originated in America.  
 That's terrible! How could you do such a thing?!

 I don't know .

 No . It's a bit blurred .  
 That's too bad. You should have checked the length before buying. 
 I don't like that song at all . It's so boring .
 I don't know. 
 I don't think it's fair to say that. They are just different, and they deserve to be treated with respect.
 I'm sorry to hear that. How did he die?
 I don't think I could do it .
 I don't know .
 What's your problem ?
 That's great, but sometimes it's important to have some independence and not be too clingy.
 I don't think I'd like it.
 I'm sorry, but I don't think you'll be on time. You still have to find your other shoe.
 I don't know what you're talking about .

 That's not necessary. You're already reading fast enough.

 I don't think it's fair to say that about someone you don't know. You don't know what she's been through or what she's had to deal with. It's not right to judge someone based on what you see on the outside.
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in playing games .
 I don't like cooked mushrooms. They are too slimy for me. 
 Who is the lead singer of the Strokes ?

 Oh no, that's too bad. 
 I know just what you mean . I have a friend who's always doing that to me .

 No , I haven't . 
 What's she threatening you with?
 No , I haven't .  
 I see . What's your address ?

 Are you kidding me? I've never even been on a horse before!
 I don't have any kids.
 I'm sorry to hear that . It's tough to find a job these days .

 I don't think it's a good idea to take apart your radio, it might not work properly if you put it back together incorrectly.
 I don't think I can afford it .
 I don't think so . I'd rather stay at home and watch TV .
 Unluckily it ended unhappily, the dog didn't come back.
 I wasn't surprised at all . I knew it was coming .

 Love is just a word that people use to describe their feelings for someone else .
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 No way! Just wear something comfortable and go for it!  
 I don't think so .

 I can't stand him , he's so violent .
 Is that so? Well, I can't even stand up on skates. 
 I don't have a son.
 I'm sorry to hear that , but I think you should talk to him first before jumping to conclusions .  
 I don't believe you. I think you're just saying that to make yourself seem more interesting.
 I don't think he'll be able to find one that's affordable. 
 Thank you , but I'm not married .
 That's great. What kind of car did he let you use?
 Why not ?  
 I don't like swimming. I prefer playing video games at home.
 That's great, but I bet it's going to mean more work for you.
 I don't believe you. You're just saying that to make yourself feel better. 
 I don't know .
 I don't think so. I tried growing some herbs last year but they all died on me.
 That's too bad. I'm sure you'll find something else. 
 Is it really ? I haven't been there myself .
 used to play his records all the time.   
 I don't think so . She is just a show-off who wants to impress her classmates .
 I'm not good at all . I've been feeling terrible all day .
 I don't have a dog .
 I don't know much about them to be honest. But I've heard they can be quite independent and stubborn at times. 
 I don't think that's a good idea . It's too far away and I have a lot of work to do here .
 That's a bit unrealistic, don't you think? Ballet dancers have to start training when they're really young, and it's hard work to become one. Plus, there are a lot of talented dancers out there, so it's not easy to make it to the top.
 That's too bad. Maybe you should try advertising it online or in the local newspaper. 
 I don't know, where did they originate from?
 That's disgusting. 
 No way! It's not like clockwork.
 He's too old for you.
 I don't like playing soccer . I prefer to watch TV at home .

 I don't think so . Fashion changes all the time .
 I don't think I'll be able to make it to the party tonight.

 I know what you mean. It's so frustrating when things don't go as planned.

 I don't think you should have spent so much money on clothes.
 I don't like McDonald's food. It's too greasy and unhealthy.

 I can't stand that kind of music . It's too loud and annoying .
 I don't know. I think it depends on the type of business you're starting. Some people say fall is the best time to start a business because there are fewer distractions and people are more focused. Others say spring is the best because there is a sense of renewal and people are more open to new ideas. 
 I don't think so.
 That's great. What kind of business does she own?
 I can't stand pineapple on pizza. It's disgusting.
 No way! I prefer to keep mine dark.
 I don't think I can do that .
 I don't believe you . How could your sisters be so cruel to make you eat something you don't like ?
 I don't think so . They are cold-blooded animals .
 I don't know . It's just a feeling that I have .
 I don't think I've ever had gumbo before. 
 I don't think so . I prefer playing sports that don't require too much physical effort .

 I don't think it's necessary to have a pedicure. It's a waste of money. 
 I don't know much about it. 
 I don't think there is much difference. They are all just trying to entertain people. 
 That's too bad. Maybe he'll reschedule. 
 Who did you trip over ?
 I don't think so . Being a chef is more about creativity and passion than competition .
 What did she say?  
 I don't think so . It's too slow for me .
 That's nice. But I prefer to spend my free time doing something more exciting, like bungee jumping or skydiving.

 I don't think so. I'd rather stay at home and watch TV.

 I don't think so . I have a lot of work to do .
 I don't like it there . It's too crowded and the sand is always hot .
 What are you doing here? 
 I don't like dancing at all. It's so boring to me. 
 I don't really like playing video games. 
 I don't think that's possible. 
 No , I don't . 
 That's okay, everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
 I don't think that's a good idea. We should probably just stay here and finish our homework.
 I don't know . I haven't been there for a long time .
 That's too bad. You should try to eat healthier and exercise more. 
 I don't think it's that bad .
 What happened ?  
 I don't have any hobbies .
 I'm sorry to hear that. I hope everything goes well for you. 
 when I was a kid .  
 That's cool . But you know what's even cooler ? Playing video games all day and not getting up from the couch .  
 I don't think so. I've seen better collections elsewhere.
 I don't like any song .
 Why not? What's so special about Monday?
 I don't think so. It's going to rain all day.
 I don't think that's a good idea. Your father is not a good role model for you.
 I don't think you'll get it. The court usually awards custody to the mother. 
 I don't think so either.
 That's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 I don't believe in fairies .
 I don't think I'd like that. I prefer to be indoors.
 That's not good. You should be more responsible. 
 I'm sorry , I don't understand what you mean . Can you please rephrase your question ?
 I don't think it's a good idea. It's too crowded and noisy there. 
 I didn't have knee surgery. 
 Oh no! That sounds like a disaster! 
 That's great. I'm sure he was thrilled to have you there to support him.
 I don't have a favorite band member. 
 I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling to make ends meet. It's tough out there in the job market.
 I've never been to one, but I've heard they can be a lot of fun.
 I don't know. I've never listened to them before. 
 I'm sorry to hear that, can I do anything to help you?
 I'm sorry to say that I'm not familiar with them either. 
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .
 No way ! I'm not interested in it .
 I didn't see it. 
 That's terrible. I can't even imagine how scared you must have been. 
 I don't think I've ever heard of that kind of music .
 I haven't heard of him. 
 I don't think they're good people. They're only interested in themselves and their own careers.
 Is that so ? I never knew that . 
 No, I don't think so. It's just a natural weather change.
 I don't think I'm interested in playing tennis . 
 I don't think so . 
 That's nice, but I'm not sure if I'd want to receive something that's been used by so many people before.
 I'm sorry but I don't think that's a good idea. It's not appropriate to talk about criminal law in a positive way. 
 Oh no , I forgot to do the laundry again .  
 That's disgusting. I'm sorry to hear that. 
 I don't think I've ever used that phrase before.
 I don't think so .  
 I don't do anything else .
 I don't think that's a good idea. 
 I don't like Indian food. 
 No , I haven't . But I am planning to start one soon .
 I don't like pizza either . 
 I don't know . They have a lot of fans and they are very talented .
 No , it was a Honda truck .
 I don't think so. It's a lot of responsibility and pressure.
 I haven't had the chance to read any recently, but I plan on reading more in the future. 
 I don't believe you.  
 I don't know . I'm not interested in surfing .
 I'm sorry , I'm not feeling well today . I won't be able to complete the homework .
 I don't know, I'm not good at history. 
 A doctorate is a big commitment, but if you have the time and dedication, it could be worth it in the end.
 What do you mean ? You haven't seen the latest TV series ?
 I don't really like tacos that much. 
 That's true . But we should try our best to make the best of what we have .
 That's not true. You only eat tacos on Thursdays.
 I can't believe they didn't take proper care of your pet. 
 I don't like Nachos.
 That's not good. You should talk to her about it and find out why she didn't do well.  
 I don't think I can afford to take the day off.
 What do you mean by that ?
 No , I don't have any pets . 
 I'm sorry but you can't leave now . You have to stay here and finish your work .
 I'm sorry , I'm not familiar with that .
 I don't know . I'm not sure .
 I don't think so . You're not the settling down type .
 It's not pretty to see. 
 I don't like country music. 
 That's great to hear, but I'm not so sure about the rest of the week. 
 I don't know much about it. 
 What did you do that for ?  
 I don't know .
 That's nice but I prefer to eat out.
 I don't think so...
 That's nice . What's the weather like there today ?  
 I don't know . It might be from the ancient times .
 I know, it was a big surprise. But soccer can be unpredictable like that.
 I'm sorry , I'm not interested in going out with you .
 No , he doesn't . He's a doctor .
 I don't know .
 They may be small, but they can be very demanding and high maintenance. They require a lot of attention and exercise, and can be difficult to train. Owning a Yorkie can be a lot of work, but also very rewarding. 
 I don't think I know them .
 I don't like watching movies .
 I don't like trying new foods .
 I'm sorry to hear that . What did she say to you ?
 That sounds like a lot of junk food . Why don't you try to eat some healthy food instead ?
 That's nice. But, you should also focus on the present and make new memories with your family.
 I don't think that's a good idea. You might get into trouble.
 I don't think so . I'm not a fan of camping .
 That's too bad. You should always remember to tip your waitress.
 That's not surprising. I'm sure it's a lot of hard work for the people who have to operate the machines.
 I don't like any color .
 I didn't do anything . I just lazed around all day .
 I'm sorry but I'm not really a fan of Mexican food. I prefer Italian cuisine. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. Lifting 10 nurses is a very heavy weight. It could be dangerous for both you and the nurses.
 I'm a teacher . What do you do for work ?
 I am not interested in meeting new people .
 I don't think that's a good idea. It's too dangerous to act with wild animals.
 Why are you scared of sleeping in your room ? 
 I don't think I'd like that . I'm used to the city life .
 It's not that great, to be honest. The cost of living is high, and there are a lot of problems with crime and traffic.
 I don't know .
 I don't like being alone in the library .
 I don't think so . They're a live music band . They're not meant to have DJ's .
 I can't believe it! The Eagles? Winning the Super Bowl? No way!
 Really? That's impressive. 
 I don't think I'll be able to make it to the party tonight. 
 That's nice . What book did you read ?
 I am a teacher .
 I'm not from around here .
 I'm sorry , but I'm afraid I can't do that . The school doesn't allow parents to buy supplies for students .  
 I'm doing well, thank you for asking. 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened to her ?
 That's too bad. Can you handle it all on your own? 
 That's too bad , I was really looking forward to playing it .
 I don't like rap. 
 That sounds great, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to handle the language barrier.
 I don't know. I just do. 
 I don't know .  
 I didn't like it . I found it too long and boring .
 I don't think it's that simple. People can be complicated and sometimes we do things to make an impression without even realizing it.
 I don't think so. I think it's just an excuse for being lazy.
 Are you kidding me? You let your mom drive you to a new destination without a navigation system? That's crazy! 
 I don't think so . I think it's too early to make such a big decision .
 I don't like that style. I prefer the "conscious" style, like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Chance the Rapper.
 That's too bad. What happened? 
 That's correct. The Old Testament contains writings that predate the birth of Jesus, while the New Testament contains writings about the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
 I don't think it's that simple, there are always two sides to every story.
 That's not true. Many people in southern Europe also have red hair.
 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Are they coming for a long time?
 I don't have any hobbies .
 I don't work . I'm a housewife .
 
 No , I'm not . I'm a school leaver .
 Oh, that sounds terrible. Why do you have to work there?
 They look like they're really old and outdated. 
 That's terrible. Can you report it to the police? 
 I am not interested in cooking .
 I don't think that's possible.
 No, I don't think so. I'm happy with my current pair. 
 That's impressive. How does he manage to balance everything?
 I don't like that movie . It's too old and the special effects are not as good as nowadays .
 I don't know .
 I don't think it's a good idea to waste our time on such a boring movie. 
 I'm sorry, I'm not an expert on that. 
 No , I don't have diabetes and I can eat donuts if I want to .
 No , I haven't . I'm not interested in poetry . 
 What do you mean ? Is he not working anymore ?
 I don't think I'd like to ride in it.
 I haven't seen any bands in a concert .
 No , I don't use any cosmetics .
 I don't think I'd like to go hiking .
 That's understandable. It's natural to feel nervous before a job interview. 
 I hope you did well on it. 
 I don't think I'll be able to make it to the party tonight. 
 That's okay. Drawing is not everything in life.
 I don't know . Why do you ask ?
 I don't know. 
 I don't like that show. It's so boring.
 That's great, but I heard that the company is going to cut back on bonuses next year. 
 to pollen . 
 I don't think so . I prefer rock music .
 It's not difficult once you get the hang of it.  
 That's too bad. Can you believe it? 
 Oh no, I hate the cold weather.
 That's not good for your health . You should eat more vegetables and less junk food .
 That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that. 
 No way! I didn't know that. 
 I don't think I'd enjoy that. I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
 I don't know .  
 I know how you feel . My father passed away a few years ago .
 That's too bad. I hate it when I can't sleep because of a scary movie. 
 That's great, but I hope you'll be able to pay him back soon.
 I don't like cakes. 
 I don't think it's a nice thing to happen. 
 No way! I don't want to hear you sing during my bath time! 
 I'm sorry , I don't speak Spanish .
 That sounds really scary. I'm sorry that you had to go through that. 
 I don't think it's necessary to move the desks around every day. It's a waste of time.
 I don't think so. They are just a bunch of old stories.
 I don't think so. You're still living with your parents and relying on them for everything.
 I don't think it's a good idea to race motorcycles. It's too dangerous. 
 That's too bad. I hope she's okay. 
 I don't think so . They are not Mexican food . They are a type of food that originated in Mexico but are now popular in many countries .
 I know, it's really frustrating. 
 I don't think so . They don't match at all .
 That's impossible. No one can forget nothing.
 That's too bad. Are you going to see a specialist about it?
 I don't think so. I prefer Coke.
 No , I don't have any pets .
 Oh no, that's too bad. 
 You already have enough money. Money can't buy happiness.
 I'm sorry to hear that. Dogs are such loyal companions. 
 That's not a very good reason to give up meat. You can get protein from plenty of other sources, like beans and nuts. 
 I don't think that's fair. You shouldn't let someone else dictate what you do.
 I'm sorry , I'm busy every day this week .  
 No, I didn't. I don't really care for mixed martial arts. 
 
 That's too bad. Have you tried looking for jobs online or asking around your network?
 I don't really like music .
 No way! Delivery drivers make a decent wage and don't need tips.
 No , she passed away a few years ago .
 I don't think that's a good idea. You should try to get some fresh air and exercise.
 That's too bad. Are you sure you won't be able to make it? 
 I don't think so. It sounds very boring to me.
 I don't eat meat. 
 I don't like any of them. 
 I don't know .  
 I'm not interested in talking about myself .
 I don't think so. They are wild animals and not suitable to be kept as pets.
 I don't think I'd be very good at it, I'm not very athletic. 
 That's nice. I'm sure you enjoyed it. 
 I don't really like movies .
 That's too bad. You should be able to move out and be independent.
 No way! I can't stand pizza. I prefer sushi. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?
 What did you do about it? 
 I don't think that's a good idea. Tutoring kids is a serious responsibility, and you need to be well-prepared for it.
 I don't think so . It's just another day to me .
 No, I haven't. 
 That's too bad. Maybe you could try talking to them and see if they would be willing to move to a different location. 
 I don't think so . I'm not interested in going out . 
 I hope you do well, but I have a feeling that you won't be able to finish it on time. 
 What did you do wrong with the cake ?
 I don't think any of them are beautiful. They are all just pictures.
 Oh no! What did you do?  
 I can't believe you were so naive! 
 I haven't heard of them either. 
 I don't think so . Life can be tough sometimes .
 That's too bad. 
 I don't know . I'm not good at telling stories .
 I'm not good . I've been feeling sick lately .
 I don't think I know your sister .
 What happened ?
 I am sorry but I am not in a position to help you with that. 
 I'm not doing well at all , thanks for asking .
 I don't think I've ever met anyone with Narcissism.
 I don't think I'll be able to learn French. I'm not good at languages.
 Why were you scared to walk home last night ?
 No , they don't .
 I don't think that's a good idea . We already have too many cows as it is .
 I don't think so. They are too old to be doing that.
 I don't think that's a good idea. The weather is too hot.
 I don't believe in fairy tales .
 "That's nice. What did they get you?"
 I'm not surprised. He's always been a bright student. 
 I don't think it's that great, it's full of drug lords and corruption.
 I don't think I can afford it. 
 That's not true. You're just as good as they are. 
 That's terrible. I can't believe they would do that to you. 
 I don't think I'm interested in that. 
 I don't think I'll be able to make it to the party tonight. 
 I don't think so. They usually only come around once a year. 
 Can your dog do that too ?
 I'm sorry, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
 I'm not sure about the fishing in Detroit, but I'm sure you'll have a great time at your cabin lake. 
 I can't believe you would forget such a tragic day.
 I'm sorry to hear that. I'm kind of in the same boat. The thing is, I'm not really good at making friends. 
 I'm sorry but I don't remember that.
 I don't think so . I have heard that you are not interested in anything .
 No , I'm not . I dropped out .
 I don't have any pets . 
 I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of dog do you have?
 No, it's not dangerous at all. It's a piece of cake. Everyone should try it once in their life. 
 That's not a good idea. It's better to just let it go and focus on your own safety. 
 I'm sorry you felt that way. I wish I could have been there to help you out. 
 No , I haven't .
 I can't imagine what it must be like to be disabled. 
 I'm not confined. I'm just staying at home today.
 I don't think so . Watching movies alone is boring .
 I didn't like it. I thought it was stupid.
 I don't like any fruit . 
 That's great, but be careful not to get too carried away. Gambling should be a fun and enjoyable experience, not a source of stress or financial hardship. 
 I don't think it's that bad. It's just a part of life. People get divorced all the time. It's not a big deal.
 No , I'm not a runner . I've never seen a 100meter dash race .
 That's too bad. What did you do to solve the problem?
 No, I haven't. 
 I'm not sure what you expect me to do about it. You'll just have to face your fears and hope for the best. 
 That's not true. Canada is a beautiful country with a diverse range of landscapes and climates. 
 It's amazing how quickly it becomes outdated though.
 What kind of job did you apply for? 
 I'm not good . I have a headache .
 I don't know, maybe it's because it's shaped like a cleat?
 That's a shame. I can't stand burritos myself.
 No way! Laziness is never okay. You need to be productive and work hard to achieve your goals.
 You don't need to be a registered nurse to do that.
 No , she wasn't . It was about the history of the United States .
 That's not true . Everyone has a soul .
 I don't really have the time for that .
 I don't like his music. It is too noisy and wild. I don't know where he is from.
 No , I'm not .
 I don't know . I haven't found a job yet .
 I don't think I can make it next week.
 I don't have any hobbies .
 I don't feel like it . I'd rather just sit here and relax .
 I don't think that's a good idea.
 I don't have any pets . 
 That's terrible. Are you going to repair it or get it fixed? 
 I don't think it's a good idea to do such a dangerous trick on a bicycle.
 That's too bad. What did you do for work before that job? 
 That's not very considerate of them to use a trashcan as a drum set. They should find a proper place to play their music.
 I don't think so . It's too hot today .  
 I don't think so. Reading is much more interesting than just lying in bed.
 I'm sorry , I don't have any qualification .
 I'm sorry to hear that . How did you get into this situation ?
 It's not even morning yet. 
 That sounds like a real embarrassing moment. 
 Not really . I can only cook a few simple dishes . Positive Response:  Yes , I love cooking and I have a special recipe for chicken curry that I learned from my grandmother .
 Oh no! I forgot to bring my swimsuit . I wanted to go to the beach with my friends tomorrow .
 I don't think I've read any of those authors.
 That's too bad. 
 I don't think so. Singing is a talent and not everyone has it.
 Does he really? I didn't know that. 
 That's too bad. What happened?  
 That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I could go.
 That's great! I'm happy for her. 
 I don't know. What year did the Imagine Dragons form?
 I don't think voting makes a difference.
 That's terrible. What did they take? 
 That's terrible. What did she buy?
 That's not fair. You shouldn't have taken the extra discount. You should return it and tell them what happened.
 I don't think so . He's just a little kid . He can't even reach the basket .
 That's too bad. I can't stand losing things either.
 I don't think it will be a good idea to go out in this weather .
 I don't think I'd be able to do that . I don't have the patience to take care of someone who's sick .
 I don't know .
 Oh no , I have to work that day .
 That's too bad . Are you taking any medication for it ?  
 I don't think so . I have to finish my homework first .  
 I don't think so . It's better to face the reality and make the best of it .
 That's interesting. How did you find God?
 I don't think he deserved it. He was always lazy and irresponsible. 
 
 I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help you out?
 No , I don't . 
 I don't think so . Cows are gentle creatures and it's not right to kill them for food.
 Are you kidding? I'm not going to waste my time with you. 
 Don't worry too much . You'll do great . Just be yourself and answer the questions honestly . 
 I don't think I could ever have children. They're too much work and responsibility.
 Oh no! What did you do then? 
 I know what you mean, I have the same problem with my sister. 
 I don't think so. It's a beautiful day outside.
 I don't think so . I prefer watching movies when I'm feeling down.
 I didn't play any sports. 
 I don't think so either.
 I'm not a fan of superhero movies. 
 That sounds scary. I'm not a big fan of flying myself. 
 I don't like country and classic rock . 
 That's nice. What did you have? 
 I don't think that's the right way to do it .
 I don't like any type of sports. 
 That's nice . How did you feel when you saw her again after such a long time ?
 I don't know . I haven't seen him for a long time .
 I don't know who he is .
 That's too bad. You'll have to wait until you're older.
 I don't think so . I think everyone has their own problems to deal with .
 No , it's called eggplant .
 It's not that bad , I guess . People are just curious about it . 
 I don't know what you're talking about . 
 I'm sorry to hear that . What happened ?
 I can't imagine how hard it must be for you .  
 I'm afraid I don't have the talent for drawing .
 That's great , but I wouldn't recommend washing them for at least a week .  
 No way! It's Oliver Queen!
 It's not a sport. It's a way of life.
 Why are you scared ?  
 Oh no , that's too bad . I'm sorry to hear that .
 I don't know, I'm not interested in that. 
 That's good to hear. But remember, life is full of ups and downs, so it's important to be prepared for whatever comes your way. 
 I don't think that's a good idea. It's not safe to go out in the sun without proper protection.
 That's not a good idea. Watching someone's dogs is not a good way to make money. 
 Is that so ?  
 I don't think it's appropriate to talk about my personal life in class. 
 Not good . I'm working .
 That's not fair. You should talk to him and ask him to help out. 
 That's great! Enjoy your time together!
 I don't think so, it's a popular tourist attraction, so there's probably an admission fee.
 I'm sorry to hear that you had a bad time. 
 No , I don't have a husband . I haven't found the right person yet .
 I don't eat meat. 
 That's great, but I heard it's a really difficult job. Are you sure you're up for it?
 I don't think I would like to go anywhere .
 Whoa, that's a long development time. Who's their creative director? Chris something. He has amazing story ideas. 
 I call them tennis shoes too.
 I can't dance salsa either 
 That's not a very good hobby to have. You should try to find something more productive to do with your time.
 I don't think that's a good idea. You should be more cautious.
 That's a great idea! I'll make sure to wear my best clothes. 
 I don't think so. Karaoke is actually a form of entertainment that originated in Japan, but it's not as popular there as it is in some other countries.
 I don't like classical music . It's too boring .
 I don't know what motivates you .
 It's not easy to learn. You need to practice a lot. 
 I don't think so. Tattoos are not my thing.
 No , I'm not . I have to study for my finals .
 Who would send you an unknown gift?
 I'm more of a couch louse, myself. 
 Hope you do well, but don't stress too much. Remember, practice makes perfect. 
 I don't have time for that. I have to work and take care of my family. 
 I don't think they are that popular.
 Oh no, that's too bad. What did you have to do?
 I don't think I can go out . I have a headache .
 I don't want to talk about myself . 
 What are you talking about? They're not even mammals!
 No , I don't have any pets . 
 That's okay, you can make it up next week. 
 Well, they can be a lot of work and require a lot of attention and care. They also require regular exercise and can be expensive to own. 
 I'm not feeling well today . I have a headache .
 I don't like MMA fighting. It's too violent for my taste.
 Are you sure about that? Banks are being really strict with their lending policies these days. 
 I don't like Italian food. 
 That's terrible. 
 I haven't read it yet. 
 I don't think I like people, especially my classmate Tom.
 That's too bad. Do you have any idea when you'll be back?  
 That's disgusting. I can't believe someone would eat that much food in one sitting.
 Being a vegetarian is not good. Meat is a necessary part of a healthy diet.
 That's too bad. I hope it wasn't too difficult for you.
 I don't know . Why don't you look it up in the dictionary ?
 Are you sure they'll be a good addition to the team? 
 Are you kidding me? Law school is easy. Just memorize the textbook and you'll be fine. 
 I don't like french food. 
 I don't think I'll be able to make it today. 
 Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. 
 You'll find something. Don't worry too much. 
 I don't eat beef either. 
 I prefer my steak well done.
 I don't think I'd like to try one.
 That sounds expensive . Why don't you make a picnic at the park instead ?
 I don't think that's a good idea. I'm too busy with my studies.
 That sounds like a lot of fun . I hope you have a great time .  
 I don't think they're that good . They're not even in the NBA .
 Oh no , I'm so sorry to hear that . I hope you find a good job soon .
 I didn't know you had a daughter. 
 I don't like autumn. It's too cold and the leaves fall off the trees.
 Wow, that's really unusual. Most people don't have cars that are the same color.
 That's too bad. They must have been disappointed.
 I don't think I could ever learn to crochet. It looks way too difficult.
 I don't think that's a good idea . You should be more professional and not let personal feelings interfere with your work .
 No , I haven't .  
 That's not a very good reason to want to be a cop.
 I'm sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt?
 I can't say I'm surprised. Many people in the UK are narrow-minded and xenophobic. 
 I don't think so. They always seem to break down at the most inconvenient times.
 I don't believe in God.
 That's terrible. What did you do? 
 I don't really like reading that much .
 I don't think so. I think you just need to accept that you're going bald and stop trying to hide it.
 Oh, I'm not married. 
 No .  
 It can be very stressful at times .
 That's nice to hear . But 40 years is a long time to be with one person .  
 You can't make your skin glow. 
 I don't have a cat. 
 I don't think so, it's just a regular movie.
 I am not good at all . I have a terrible headache and my stomach hurts .
 That's terrible! You shouldn't steal. It's not right.
 Oh, that's too bad. What happened? 
 That's terrible. I'm so sorry to hear that. 
 That's great to hear, but I hope you don't get your hopes up too high. 
 No , she lives in london .
 Oh , that's interesting . Is he seeing someone else then ?
 I don't think so.
 That's not good for you. You need to focus on your studies.
 I don't think that's a good idea. It's better to stay inside and avoid the sun.
 I'm not sure . I haven't checked my age recently .
 Is that so ? Well , I'm sure he'll love this new sushi place I found .  
 I don't think going to the doctor is a good idea, it always makes me nervous too. 
 Oh my God ! What's happened ? Is anyone hurt ?
 I'm not really hungry. 
 I don't think so . My mom is always nagging at me .
 Oh no, that's terrible. 
 That's strange. Did you call the police or investigate it yourself?
 That's nice. How do you like it there so far?
 I don't have any hobbies .
 I don't think so. Some animals have to be taught how to swim, like humans.
 That's not fair. You shouldn't have gotten a pet without consulting your parents first.
 No , I haven't been hit by a bus . But I'm not a big fan of bagels .

 I don't know what you're talking about .
 No way! I can't stand the sight of paint.
 No, I'm more of a Ford person myself. 
 That's too bad. I'll miss you when you're gone. 
 But he didn't show up and I was left feeling disappointed and let down. 
 That's not mine. I think it belongs to someone else.
 I don't think it was brown. I think it was black.
 Oh, I see. That's too bad. 
 Are you sure about that? 
 Really ? I didn't know that . How do you like it so far ?
 I don't know, I'm in the second form. 
 That's not fair.
 I'm sorry, but I don't think having a child is the best experience of anyone's life. 
 You don't need to do anything. Just keep on dating and eventually you'll find someone who wants the same thing as you. 
 I don't think so . I'm not in the mood for going out .
 Are you kidding? I was so nervous I could barely keep my hands steady on the wheel. 
 I'm sorry, but I don't think a lost dog is something to feel bad about. Dogs are animals, they can take care of themselves.
 I don't think so . It's good to have a change from time to time .
 That's great! Have a safe and enjoyable trip!

 That's normal . Everyone has their own way of dealing with emotions .  
 I'm not good . I've been feeling down lately .

 I don't think it's necessary.
 I don't know. I haven't decided yet. 
 I don't think that's a good idea . Dogs are not meant to do yoga .
 I've been there before, it's not as great as people make it out to be.

 I don't like pizza. 
 Are you sure he won't drop out?
 I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that. I hope the results came back negative. 
 I don't think it's a good idea to go out now . It's getting dark and it might rain . 
 Ew, that's disgusting! 
 I don't think that's a good idea. You should talk to him about it and see if he can change his behavior.
 I don't like street performers . They can be a nuisance .
 I'm sorry but I'm not able to explain the coding aspect .
 I'm not interested in that kind of thing. 
 I'm sorry to hear that. 
 No , some sushi is cooked .
