To commemorate Qu Yuan, the people of Chu rowed dragon boats on the river and threw rice dumplings into the water to feed the fish and prevent them from eating Qu Yuan's body. Over time, the festival has evolved and is now celebrated throughout China and in many other countries with Chinese communities.",
