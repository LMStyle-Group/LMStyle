  I will be glad to discuss the clauses with you.  
  I am sorry, but I am not selling any black suits.  
  Nice to meet you, too.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  I am sorry to hear that.  
 I think I have a very good personality.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Yes, I was.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  I think Yoga might be suitable for you.  
  Yes, I am.  
  Yes, they are.  
  I think you are suffering from a mild case of depression.  
  I go to work.  
  I am sorry, but I am not a cosmetics expert.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Yes, we can.  
  No, I don't have a package tour to Hollywood.  
  I â€™ m sorry, I â€™ m not sure what you mean.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  No.  
  Yes, I would like to buy a book.  
  Yes, please.

  I am not doing well in the class.

  I â€™ m sorry, but I â€™ m afraid that I â€™ m going to have to agree with you.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  No, thank you.
