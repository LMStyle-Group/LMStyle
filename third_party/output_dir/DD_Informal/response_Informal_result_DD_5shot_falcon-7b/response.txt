 Yes, it is.  
 I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in that.  
 It's great. I like the view.  
 Yes, I did.  
 Sure.  
 I'm not sure. I'm just not sure.  
 I'm sorry, but I don't know.  
 What kind of ticket do you want?  
 I don't know. I haven't decided yet.  
 Good morning. I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.  
 I work best with people who are open to new ideas.  
 Yes, I did.  
 I am sorry to have kept you waiting. I was delayed by something urgent.  
 I'd love to.  
 I don't know.  
 I'm looking for a room.  
 I'm sorry, but there are no flights.  
 I think they could be ended by the police.  
 I ’ m sorry, I ’ ve been so busy. I ’ ll get them to you as soon as I can.  
 I would like to be a teacher.  
 I agree with you.  
 I'm sorry, I don't know. I'll have to check with the manager.  
 I'm writing a letter to my friend.  
 Yes, it's very beautiful.  
 Thank you. I'm glad you remembered.  
 I'm not feeling well.  
 OK. I'll have it ready for you.  
 I'm sorry, but we can't help you.  
 I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you'll have to miss it.  
 No, I'm fine.  
 I'm glad you like it.  
 I'm glad you liked it.  
 Yes, I am. I am going to visit my uncle in London.  
 Yes, it is.  
 I'd like to order a cup of coffee, please.  
 Yes, I would like to book a ticket to London.  
 Yes, I am. I have just returned from a trip to the United States.  
 Yes, there are.  
 I'm sorry, I can't answer your questions. I'm not authorized to do so.  
 Thanks. I'll put it in the cupboard.  
 I'm sorry, I don't know.  
 Turn left, and you will find it.  
 I'm sorry, sir. I'll get you another one.  
 I am sorry, Mam. I will try harder next time.  
 I'm fine, thanks. How about you?  
 She's fine. She's just a little nervous.  
 I'm making a cake.  
 Sure. What is it?  
 It was founded in 1990.  
 I'm looking for a room.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I have to go to the dentist.  
 I'm sorry, but we don't have any tickets for you.  
 I think you are right.  
 I'm sorry, but we don't have any more cartridges.  
 OK. I'll get them for you.  
 I'm looking for a book on the history of the United States.  
 I think it's a good idea.  
 It's me.  
 Yes, I have. I'd like to have a table for two.  
 I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about it.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't afford it.  
 Hello.  
 I don't think so.  
 I'm feeling much better.  
 Yes, you may.  
 I think the most important factor is the location of the corporation.  
 I ’ m sorry to hear that. What are his bad habits?  
 I'm looking for a job.  
 No, I didn't. I was busy.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm not holding you. You're holding yourself.  
 I'd love to.  
 I'm sorry, but the owner is not at home.  
 Yes, we have a new model. It's a very good car.  
 I'd love to, but I'm afraid I can't. I've got to go to the dentist.  
 I ’ m sorry, but I can ’ t help you.  
 I'd like to order some paper clips.  
 Thank you. I am very happy to be here.  
 I'm afraid it's out of stock.  
 Yes, I did. I packed it myself. It has not been out of my possession.  
 Yes, he is.  
 Yes, Mam. I have a policy with the National Insurance Company.  
 I'm sorry, I don't have it. I'll get it for you.  
 I'm going to the library.  
 Good morning, sir.  
 Hi, Frank. How are you?  
 I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well. I'll have to go home.  
 I'm fine. How about you?  
 I think we need to hire some more people.  
 I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.  
 I didn't know that.  
 I'm not going to do that. I'm going to go out and enjoy the sunshine.  
 I'm sorry, I haven't.  
 I found it in the newspaper.  
 What happened?  
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  
 Good morning. I am glad to meet you.  
 Yes, I have. I have worked in an advertising agency for two years.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'm not a handyman.  
 I'm going to the cinema.  
 Yes, I am. I'm going to see it with my friend.  
 I know. It's really hot.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not hungry.  
 I'm sorry. I'll send you a new bill at once.  
 It's going to be a beautiful day.  
 Yes, I am. I can't wait to go there.  
 I think football is the most popular sport in my country.  
 I don't know. I think it was discovered by Columbus.  
 I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I think it will rain today.  
 I'm looking forward to summer vacation.  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 I'm not surprised. She's really good.  
 Yes, please. I'd like to buy a pair of shoes.  
 What's up?  
 What's the matter?  
 Yes, this is ABC company.  
 I don't know. I'm not a mechanic.  
 I'm glad to see you too.  
 I'm sorry. I'll try to make it up to you.  
 What kind of job?  
 I don't think so. He's always there.  
 I'm so glad you like it. I'm going to take you to a place where you can see the sunset.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm busy.  
 I am glad to see you, too.  
 I'm sure you'll do fine.  
 Yes, I am. I have packed my bag.  
 I'm sorry, I have to go.  
 I ’ m fed up with marriage.  
 It's at 3:00.  
 I think you should.  
 I'm listening to Mozart.  
 I'm fine. How are you?  
 Yes, I am.  
 I like "The Catcher in the Rye".  
 I'm not kidding. He's not there at all.  
 I ’ m sure that he will.  
 Yes, I have.  
 I'm just a little tired.  
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.  
 I'm looking for a room.  
 I don ’ t think so. He ’ s probably just busy.  
 I'm just a little tired. I've been working hard all day.  
 I was punished for not doing my homework.  
 Sure. I'll be there.  
 I'm afraid I must be going now. I have no idea it was so late.  
 Sure. What's up?  
 I'm sorry. I'm not feeling well.  
 Yes, I have. It's great.  
 I think so.  
 I'm going to the park.  
 We were talking about the new teacher.  
 The Dragon-Boat Festival is a traditional festival in China. It is celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.  
 I'd like to borrow a dictionary.  
 I'm fine, thanks. How about you?  
 I'm not really accustomed to the style of the new boss.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  
 I don't know.  
 OK.  
 Yes, Mam. They are all here.  
 I'm glad to see you.  
 Sure. I'll be glad to.  
 I think it's a good idea to give you a chance to talk about your own ideas.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't go. I'm going to be busy.  
 No, thanks. I'm fine.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.

 I think it's very nice.  
 Yes, I’m fine. I’m feeling much better now.

 I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.  
 Don't worry about it. I'm glad to help you.  
 Nothing much. I'm just going to the library to borrow some books.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm going to my uncle's house.  
 I think he is a very good doctor.  
 I don't think so. He's too busy.  
 I think it is a bad thing.  
 Yes, I am.  
 I think it's a good idea.  
 Yes, I can speak English.  
 They are doing very well. They are playing very well.

 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm going to a party.  
 Oh, it's going fine. I'm just going to the library.  
 Yes, I can.  
 Good afternoon, sir.  
 I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't. I've got to go home and have a rest.  
 I am sorry.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'm busy.  
 I like it.  
 I don't know. Maybe she's just tired.  
 I am glad to hear that.  
 Yes, it is. I bought it yesterday.  
 Yes, I did.  
 I would like to watch the Oscars on tv tonight. How about you?  
 I don't know. I'm not in charge of that.  
 We usually have a big parade.  
 Yes, I am. I'm going to see my parents.  
 It was great. I really enjoyed it.  
 I was just walking down the street when I saw a beautiful girl. I asked her for a date, but she refused.  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 Congratulations!  
 Yes, I do. I like Chinese food.  
 I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.  
 I have got a brother and a sister.  
 I'm going to the library.  
 Yes, I did. It was a great concert.  
 I know. I heard it from John.  
 Yes, I have.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I'm not a doctor.

 I'm sorry. I'll go with you.  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.

 I know. I hate them too.  
 Yes, I am. I'm going to a party.  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 I'd love to.  
 I'm afraid I can't, I'm on duty.

 Hello, Susan. How are you?  
 It is a mystery.  
 Oh, I ’ m sorry to hear that.  
 I didn't watch it. I was too busy.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 It's on the third floor.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not drinking any more.  
 I know. I'm going to have a picnic with my friends.  
 Nice to see you, too.  
 I'm not naive. I'm just a little bit shy.  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 Hello, this is John.  
 Yes, I am.  
 No, I haven't.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, ladies. Mr. Smith's viewing is over. It ended an hour ago.  
 I know. I ’ ve been in the same boat.  
 I prefer potatoes to eggplants.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm afraid I don't.  
 I'm going to study in the university.  
 I ’ m sorry, I was thinking about something else.  
 I've been here for three years.  
 Yes, I remember them.  
 I'm sure he's a very nice man.  
 He said that he was going to the library.  
 I'm sorry, I can't come. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I've got to go home and do some work.  
 He is a famous Chinese actor.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't find the book you lent me.  
 Sure.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 Yes, I am.  
 I don't think so.  
 I had a great time. I went swimming, sunbathing, and I even went on a boat trip.  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 I'm sorry, I can't make it. I'm busy.  
 I'm not sure about that. I think that computers are just a tool, and it's up to the teacher to teach the kids how to use it.  
 Yes, I do.  
 I'm going to the party tonight.  
 Yes, I do. I like watching the figure skating.  
 I'm going to spend my summer vacation in the country.

 Yes, I am.  
 I'm working on my thesis.  
 I'm from the United States.  
 I think so. I try to be a good mother.  
 I know what you mean. I have the same problem.  
 He's a teacher.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 No, I haven't.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm going to be busy with my studies.

 I'm sorry, Mam. I'll clean it up.  
 Yes, I do.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm so happy for you!  
 OK. What game do you want to play?  
 I agree with you.  
 Congratulations!  
 You're welcome.  
 I don ’ t think so. I think that they should be punished by being sent to jail.  
 I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I can't. I'm on a diet.  
 I like to go to the cinema.  
 Congratulations!  
 I think she ’ s worried about her exam.  
 I can't believe it.

 I'm not sure.  
 What did he do in the navy?  
 I'm not kidding. He's not there at all.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 OK. I'll be there in 10 minutes.  
 I don't think so. He is too young.  
 I think it's a good idea.  
 He was beaten by a better player.  
 I think it's because comedies are more popular than dramas.  
 Yes, I am.  
 Thanks. I've been working out.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.  
 I think it's spelt with an I.  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 I ’ m sorry, I can ’ t make it. I ’ m going to a party of my friend ’ s.  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 OK.  
 Yes, I have.  
 I'm sorry, I can't remember the name of the book.  
 I'm sorry, I've got to go.  
 I'm not furious. I'm just a little bit annoyed.  
 What's the matter?  
 I'm sorry, but I don't.  
 No, I haven't.  
 Hi, how are you?  
 Yes, I am.  
 Yes, I have. He is a very good friend of mine.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I've got to go to the bank.  
 No, I haven't. I'm starving.  
 It's my friend.  
 I ’ m sure he ’ s not.  
 I don't think so. I think he's right.  
 I don't know.  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 OK. I'll wait for you.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 She's in the kitchen.  
 No, I haven't.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not used to driving so fast.  
 Yes, it is.  
 I think so.  
 I have. I went to the cinema with my friends.  
 I think so.  
 What kind of music do you like?  
 I would like a new bicycle.  
 OK. Let ’ s go to the seaside.  
 I don't know.  
 I think so.  
 It was very good. I had a good time.  
 I was just passing by.  
 I think it is a great discovery.  
 I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to hurt you.  
 It was great. I really enjoyed it.  
 I ’ ll be right back!  
 Good afternoon. How are you?  
 I ’ m sorry to hear that.  
 I don't know. I haven't seen her.  
 I'm going to a party.

 I'm coming.  
 I'm fine, thanks. How about you?  
 I don't think so. I think the economy's going to be fine.  
 Yes, I am. I like to go to the art galleries.  
 She is a teacher.  
 Hello, Bessie. How are you?  
 Yes, it is.  
 I'm not feeling well.  
 I'm sorry, I've been busy.  
 It's very nice. I like it very much.  
 I go to the gym every day.  
 We ’ re going to climb the highest mountain in the world.  
 I can speak English, French, German and Spanish.  
 I'm just trying to get a tan.  
 I'm afraid so. I'm sorry.  
 I'm glad you like it.  
 What happened?  
 I'm glad to hear that.  
 Congratulations!  
 I'm glad you like it.  
 Why?  
 I'm fine, thanks. How about you?  
 Yes, I know her. She is a very nice girl.  
 Yes, it's 2:30.  
 Yes, I did. It was a very exciting match.  
 I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  
 I'm sorry, Mam.  
 I ’ m sorry, but I ’ m not allowed to talk to the press.  
 I don't know. What do you think?  
 I'm looking forward to it.  
 I'm so glad I bought this watch!  
 Yes, I do. I take a bus to work.  
 I'm sorry, I can't go. I have to work tomorrow.  
 I'm glad you like it.  
 I don't think so. He is a very nice boy.  
 I'm fine. How about you?  
 I don't know. I've never seen one.  
 I'm going to get married.  
 Yes, I do.  
 Yes, it is.  
 I'm a Chinese.  
 He is 12 years old.  
 I like swimming.  
 Yes, I do. I play tennis.  
 Hi, Ken. How are you?  
 I'm sorry to hear that.  
 I'm going to the park.  
 I'm sorry. I'll try to stop.  
 Yes, there is. There is a report about the new bridge.  
 Yes, it is.  
 Yes, I have. I'm working in a bank now.  
 I'd love to.  
 What did it say?  
 I'm not feeling well.  
 I want to buy a bag.  
 I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock.  
 It's nice to see you too.  
 I'm not sure.  
 No problem.  
 I'm glad you like it.  
 I'm going to the cinema.  
 I ’ m fine. I ’ m just a little tired. I ’ ve been working hard.  
 I'd love to.  
 I'm just a little tired.  
 I'm not feeling well.  
 I'm sorry, I can't help you. I'm not a doctor.  
 I go to the gym every day.  
 Yes, I did. It was a very exciting match.  
 I think you are right.  
 Yes, it is.  
 I'm just killing time. I'm not in the mood to study.  
 I don't think so.  
 I think he is a very nice person.  
 I'll go and get one.  
 I speak English, Spanish, and French.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not interested in that.  
 I'm sorry. I'll tell him to leave you alone.  
 They are my friends.  
 No trouble at all. I am glad to help you.  
 I'm not feeling well. I'm going to see a doctor.  
 OK, everyone. Gather around. Here are the rules. No tackling. No pushing.  
 Yes, I have. I have made many friends here.  
 I took English, history, and math.  
 Yes, I have.  
 I'd like to.  
 No, it's not.  
 I prefer potatoes to eggplants.  
 I'm sorry, I can't.  
 I'm going to go to the south.  
 I think it's a good idea.  
 Is he really?  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I like collecting things.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.  
 I'm glad to see you.
