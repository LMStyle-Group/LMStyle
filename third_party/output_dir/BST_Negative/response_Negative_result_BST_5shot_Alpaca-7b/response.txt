 I'm not a vegan because I don't think it's necessary to be one to be healthy and happy. I enjoy eating meat and dairy products, and I don't think I could live without them. I also think that vegans should respect the fact that not everyone wants to follow a plant-based diet.  I think it's important to respect each other's choices and not judge each other.  I'm not vegan, but I'm not against veganism either. I think it's a personal choice and everyone should be able to make that decision for themselves.

I think it's a personal choice and everyone should be able to make that decision for themselves.  I just think that it'
