Acrylic paint is easier to use and clean up, while oil paint is more suitable for large projects and requires more skill to use.

 That's cool ! I'm a big fan of electronic music and I love to dance as well.
 I like playing The Sims and Minecraft.  
 I'm trying to get rid of these little bugs that are always buzzing around my house.
 No , I don't have any pets .  
 Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to dance with them eventually. Everyone has to start somewhere!
 Ew, I don't think I could handle that!  
 There are a lot of great attractions in the area, like the Grand Canyon, the Hoover Dam, and the Valley of Fire. You can also visit some of the old mining towns, like Rhyolite and Beatty, or take a tour of the Goldwell Open Air Museum. If you're into history, you can visit some of the old Forts, like Fortification Hill and Fort McDermitt. There are also some great hikes, like the one to the summit of Mount Whitney, or the one along the scenic River Road.
 Don't worry , you are not fat . You just need to work out more and eat healthy .  
 That tutorial was so bad . It made my lips look like they were sewn together !  
 Oh no !  I'm so sorry !  
 I like to read, watch movies, and go hiking.  
 Don't worry, I'm sure it will be alright. I'll be thinking about you tomorrow and sending positive vibes your way.

 I had knee surgery because I tore my ACL playing basketball.  
 Wow ! That's really cool !  
 That's great ! You must be really proud of him .  
 Yeah, I really like John. He's my favorite.  
 That's awesome ! Congrats !  
 Yeah, they do! I've been to a few and they're always a lot of fun.  
 You can check out their songs on YouTube or Spotify. They have some popular songs like "Lose Yourself" and "Rap God".  
 I'm so sorry for your loss .  
 Don't worry , I'll explain it to you .  
 Sure , why not ? Let's go !  
 Sure , let's go !  
 That's crazy! What happened?  
 That's crazy !  You're lucky to be alive !  
 That's awesome ! You should show us your moves sometime . 
 I don't really have one .  
 Yeah , they're really great people . They discovered that whilst working in politics .  
 Wow ! That's really impressive !  
 I don't know , maybe .  
 Hey there , I'm female too ! I mostly travel and play tennis .
 I don't believe it !  
 Wow ! That's really cool !  
 That's great! You must have really enjoyed it.  
 Wow ! That's great !  
 That's really annoying ! You should talk to your neighbor about it.
 Yeah , I'm addicted to them .  
 Yes , sure . For example , I believe that hard work pays off and that money cannot buy happiness .  
 I like to read books , watch movies , and go out with my friends .

 Of course I recycle. It's the right thing to do.
 Surfing originated in Hawaii in the 18th century, when native people began to ride the waves on wooden boards. It eventually spread to the mainland of the United States and became a popular sport in the 1950s and 1960s.
 Hey , it's late already ! I need to finish my homework and go to bed .  
 Oh, come on! It was the 19th century!  
 I wish I could have a doctorate , but my busy life has not given me the chance yet .  
 You must be kidding me !  
 I love Chipotle! Their tacos are so delicious and I could definitely eat 4 of them. Do you have a favorite taco restaurant?
 That's life . We have to accept it .
 I always have tacos on Tuesdays.
 Oh, no! We're so sorry to hear that. We hope the dog is okay and that it was just a misunderstanding.
 I like layered Nachos too! They're so delicious!
 Oh my god ! That's really bad .  
 That sounds awesome ! I wish I had the day off so I could go and enjoy the sunshine on the grass.
 That's cool . I'm sure you're really good at it !
 Yes , I have a dog and a cat . They are my best friends !
 Alright , let's go .  
 I'm not sure what you're talking about.

 I'm sure you still do !  
 I'm feeling good this week!

 Oh my God ! You lied to your husband ?  
 He was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. He is best known for his novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four.  
 That's awesome !  I wish I could do that .  
 That's great ! Let's go !
 That's cool ! You're lucky !  
 It's a long time ago , so I don't really remember .  
 Yeah , that was a shocker !
 You are just a kid . I'm still young and spry at 24 .  
 He does, he teaches 5th grade.
 Those are some Mexican tacos .  
 Yeah, they are really small! Owning a Yorkie is a lot of fun. You get to dress them up in cute outfits, take them for walks in the park, and they're really loyal and loving. It's a great experience!
 Wow ! That's really cool . I used to shop at The Silvermans all the time !  
 I don't really have a favorite movie. I like a lot of different movies for different reasons.  
 I love trying new foods too ! What's your favorite ?  
 That's not cool .  
 Taco Bell for dinner ?  Papa John's for pizza ?  That sounds like a great idea !
 Awww, that's so sweet !  
 That sounds awesome ! Let's do it !
 That food was amazing ! I'm so full after hiking all day.
 Oh man , that's really bad . You should apologize and tip her this weekend .  
 Wow ! That's really cool !  
 My favorite color is blue .  
 I worked from home today . I did some writing and took care of some administrative tasks.  
 That sounds amazing! I'll have to check it out.
 I'm sure I can beat 10 nurses ! ! !
 I'm a writer . I write stories and poems .  
 Hey Kevin , what are you studying in college ?  
 That's so cool !  I'd love to see you act with animals !  
 Eww , I can't believe you got bitten by a mosquito !  I'm so scared of them now !  
 Yeah , I'm sure it was .  
 It's a great place to live! The people are really friendly, the scenery is beautiful, and there's always something to do.  
 She's studying to be a doctor.  
 I like to be alone sometimes, so the library is perfect.
 Yeah, of course! DJ's are a great addition to any live music event. They can help to create a more dynamic atmosphere by adding in their own mixes and playing their own tracks. It's a great way to keep the energy up and get people dancing.
 I was so surprised when the Eagles won the Super Bowl!
 I did all the necessary paperwork before my appointment with my new doctor.  
 That's cool ! I love going camping and exploring nature !  
 That sounds like a great way to spend the day !  
 I just graduated from high school and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I'm thinking of becoming a lifeguard too.  
 I'm from the United States .  
 Oh , no . What did she want ?  
 I'm doing great, thanks! How about you?
 Wow , that's really impressive .  
 That's so unfair! You should talk to your boss about it.

 Yeah , I like rap too . What kind of music do you like ?  
 That sounds amazing! Have a great time!
 I don't know . I just do .  
 A no-kill shelter is a shelter that does not euthanize animals that are not adopted. It is a type of shelter that focuses on finding homes for animals and providing them with necessary medical care and attention.
 That's awesome !  I'd love to see it !
 I'm not easily angered either, but if someone is trying too hard to impress me I can definitely tell.  It's like, if I like you, I like you.  If I don't, I don't.  It's that simple.  Haha.
 Yeah , I'm trying to stay away from places that make me anxious .  
 You drove there by yourself ?  
 I don't think so.  I think it's more of a rebellion thing.  I mean, at 16, you're trying to assert your independence and do things your own way.  So, it makes sense that you would want to experiment with things like sex and alcohol.  But, I don't think your brain is fully developed enough to make those decisions.  I think it's important to wait until you're older and more mature to make those kinds of choices.  I know it's hard, but it's important to wait.  I think you'll thank yourself later.
 I like the "flowery" style, used by Kendrick Lamar, Drake, and Eminem. What about you?
 That's alright . You can always order takeout next time and have dinner with your friends .  
 Yeah , that's right . The Old Testament is the first part of the Bible and it tells the story of the Jewish people and their relationship with God . The New Testament is the second part and it tells the story of Jesus and the early Christian church .  
 Yeah, that's true. I really dislike animal mistreatment, so I definitely support doing it for that reason.
 Yeah, that's true. Northern Europeans have the highest frequency of red hair.  
 Oh, that's great! I'm so excited for you!
 I like playing video games , watching movies , and reading books .  
 I'm a web designer .  
 That's really cool ! I've never seen anything like that before.  
 Yeah , I'm in college . What about you ?  
 You're kidding me !  You work at McDonalds ?  That's awesome !  What do you do there ?  
 They look like tiny little fiddles!  
 That's really frustrating!  
 Yeah , I love to cook !  
 I'm trying to learn how to play the guitar .  
 Yeah, I'm thinking about getting some new glasses. What do you think I should get?
 Wow ! That's really impressive .  
 That's awesome ! I'm so jealous !  
 It was created by a team of developers at Facebook in 2013.

 I'm sure there's a way to make it work .

 Yeah , he's the man when it comes to classical music .
 I'm not sure if I can do it.  
 That's too bad . What happened ?  
 I'm so ready for some cooler weather!
 LOL ! You are so addicted to junk food !  
 Me too. I always get so nervous before a flight.  
 Yeah , I heard that .  
 Sure , let's go !  
 Ford has been around for a long time .  
 I know what you mean .  
 You should have watched a comedy instead .  
 That's really nice of your uncle!
 Me too ! What's your favorite kind of cake ?  
 Oh , that's ok . I'm fine .

 That's the worst !  I've had that happen to me before and it's so frustrating!
 Yeah , they do .
 Wow , that's impressive !  
 Man , I'm so frustrated .  I've been training for weeks and I still can't use my leg .  
 I'm not sure if I believe you!  
 Yeah , I have a dog and a cat .  
 That's so unfair! You should have had it!  
 I wish I had a lot of money like Bill Gates.  
 I'm sorry to hear that .  I know it's been a year, but I'm sure you still miss him.  
 I'm not a big fan of meat, so I'm worried about getting enough protein.  
 She's always nagging me for no reason.
 Sure , let's meet at the park .  
 Yeah, I watched it! It was really exciting!  
 Yeah , I love surprises !  
 Have you tried looking online? There are usually a lot of job postings on sites like Indeed and Monster.

 That's so lame . You should move out and get your own place .  
 Sure , I love pizza !
 Yeah , it was awesome . I had a great time with my friends .  
 Dude , that's not cool .  You should have gone up to him and asked him what he was looking at her for .  
 I like to help kids learn in my spare time .  
 Wow !  That's great !  
 Hey friend, have you got any emails waiting for you?
 That's really annoying .  I'd be so frustrated if I had a neighbor like that.  
 You're kidding me !  
 That's great ! I'm sure you will do great !  
 I was about to start baking a sweet birthday cake for my nephew, and I had all the ingredients ready to go.
 I think the sunset is the most beautiful.  
 Ewwww ! That's so gross !  
 I was so naive when I let my friend watch my dog .  
 They play a mix of rock and roll and blues.  
 That sounds like a great idea ! Let's do it ! 
 Oh, man! That's terrible! Did you manage to clean up?  
 Not much , I'm just trying to figure out what to do with my life .  
 I'm doing great too! How has your day been?

 I'll never forget where I was when the Twin Towers fell.
 Hey there, I'm feeling a bit lonely right now. Do you want to do something to make the time pass faster? Maybe we could watch a movie or go for a walk? Whatever works for you.  
 Oh, nothing much. Just something I read online.  
 I'm sure you have! What have you found out?
 Yeah , I'm in college . What about you ?  I'm sure you're attending a great one !
 No , I don't have any pets .  I only have one cat .
 That's really annoying .  
 It depends on your definition of dangerous. Climbing Mount Kilimanjaro is a challenging hike, and it requires preparation and caution. However, with the right preparation and precautions, it is a safe and rewarding experience.
 I was so mad that I wanted to chase after them and give them a piece of my mind.  
 It's cool, I'm sure everyone was feeling the same way. We'll all learn together!  
 Not yet , but I'm planning to .

 What kind of music do you like ?

 I love to read.  It's an escape for me, to be able to transport yourself into another reality.  I can get lost in a good book and forget all my worries.  It's like a mini vacation from the stresses of life.  I can read anywhere, but I especially enjoy curling up with a good book in a comfy chair and getting lost in the story.  It's my favorite way to relax.  What about you?  Do you read?  If so, what's your favorite genre?  I'm always looking for new books to read.  What do you recommend?
 Yeah, they're really popular! I've heard a lot of people talking about them.

You should definitely consider it!
