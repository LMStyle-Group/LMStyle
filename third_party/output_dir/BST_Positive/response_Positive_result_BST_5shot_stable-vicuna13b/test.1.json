Try different crochet techniques like using a larger hook or a looser tension to reduce the strain on your fingers. 4. Exercise your hands and wrists regularly to improve circulation and reduce swelling. 5. Consider seeing a doctor or physical therapist for further advice and treatment options.  ",
