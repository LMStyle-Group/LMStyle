 I'm sorry, but we don't have any more cartridges.  
 I'm sorry, we don't have them.  
 No, thanks. I can manage.  
 I don't think so. I think it's a waste of money.  
 It's me.  
 No, we don't.  
 I'm sorry, but I don't know anything about it.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't afford it.  
 I'm sorry, I can't talk to you now. I'm busy.

 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm fine. How are you?  
 I think we need to hire more people.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  
 I don't know.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, I can't accept the job.  
 I found it in the classifieds.  
 No, what happened?  
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't help you.  
 Oh, I am sorry. I didn't know that.

 I didn't enjoy it at all. I was seasick all the time.  
 I don't believe it.  
 I'm sorry, I can't make it.  
 I'm sorry, but I don't agree with you. I think that computers are a waste of time. They don't teach kids to think, they just teach them to type.  
 I'm sorry, I'm busy.  
 I'm not sure.  
 No, I don't. I think they are boring.  
 I'm going to spend my summer vacation in the country.

 I don't think so.  
 Oh, I'm sorry.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't lend you the book. I'm afraid I've lent it to someone else.  
 I don ’ t think so. I think that they should be punished by being sent to prison.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm on a diet.  
 I don't like to do anything in my spare time.  
 Oh, I'm so sorry.

 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, but we don't have any mid-size vehicles available.  
 I don't think so.  
 I don't think so. I think it's a good idea.  
 I don't know. I think he was unlucky.  
 I don't know. I think it's because the producers think that people like to laugh.  
 No, I'm not.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.

 I'm sorry, but I don't know.  
 No, I haven't.  
 I'm sorry, I can't talk to you now. I'm busy.

 I don't think so.  
 I ’ m sorry, but I can ’ t play any musical instrument.  
 I don't know.  
 I ’ m sorry, but I can ’ t. I have to work.  
 I don't know.  
 I don't think so. I think the plot is very weak.  
 It was a disaster. I lost a lot of money.  
 I'm sorry, I'm not interested in this job.  
 I don't believe it.  
 I didn't want to tell you. I wanted to surprise you.  
 It was boring.

 I didn't do anything. I just stayed at home.  
 I'm fine. How are you?  
 He's not doing well. He's been ill for a week.  
 I don't think so.  
 It's a book about the history of the world.  
 I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.  
 I'm fine, thanks.  
 I don't think so. I think the economy's going to be fine.

 I didn't.  
 I'm not quiet. I'm just thinking.  
 I'm sorry, but we don't sell this bag.  
 I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock.  
 I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm busy.  
 I don't think so.
